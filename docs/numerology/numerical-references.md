## Dictionary of Significant Numerical Calculations

### Primary Numbers

If you recall from earlier, while there are 26 letters in the English alphabet, each is assigned a number from 1 to 9 via Pythagorean numerology.&#x20;

Based on this letter-to-number correspondence, your name has many applications in numerology.Your birth name has a significant impact on who you are as a person. Using numerology, you can discover hidden abilities and talents. You can also gain insight to your innermost desires and how others perceive you.

Using numerology to analyze your birth name helps give you a better understanding of yourself and your abilities, including how you typically act in an emergency and what traits make you most successful.

== Name

The following are numerology values you can find using your birth name:

1. **Destiny Number:** Sometimes called the Name Number, the Destiny Number is derived from adding the letter values in your birth name. It indicates what talents and aptitudes you were born with, what you are destined to do in your life, and how you can best utilize your talents and interests to be successful (see Chapter 3).
2. **Soul Number:** Also called the Heart Number or Birth Force Number, the Soul Number is calculated from the vowels in your name. This number helps you discover the real, inner you, including your values, hopes, wishes, dreams, and innermost desires as well as your thoughts, feelings, and attitudes toward life and love (see Chapter 4).
3. **Personality Number:** This number is calculated using the consonants in your name and tells you about the outer you, or what you project to those around you. The Personality Number doesn‚Äôt always convey the real you‚Äîonly the impression you make on others (see Chapter 5).
   1. Destiny # - Soul # = Personality #
4. **Intensification Numbers:** An above-average amount of certain letters and their corre-sponding values in your name are how you find your Intensification Numbers. They can tell you more about your personality, such as whether you‚Äôre extravagant or have great self-discipline (see Chapter 7).
5. **Karma Numbers:** Any letters you‚Äôre missing in your full birth name and its correspond-ing number value indicate your Karma Numbers. These numbers tell you the skills and attributes you may need to cultivate to help you better handle situations in your lifetime (see Chapter 7).
6. **Subconscious Response Number:** To get this number, you determine how many Karma Numbers you have and subtract that from 9. This number reveals how you instinctively act in an emergency‚Äîin other words, whether you‚Äôre apt to panic or remain calm (see Chapter 7).
7. **Point of Security Number:** This number is derived from adding the amount of letters in your full birth name. The Point of Security Number indicates what you have within you to be successful both personally and professionally, no matter what obstacles come up in your life (see Chapter 7).
8. **Hidden Essence and Essence Numbers:** These are calculated by adding the numeric values of the letters in your first, middle, and last names and progressing them on a chart. Your Hidden Essence and Essence Numbers represent conditions and circum-stances you may experience at any given age of your life (see Chapter 8).

== Birthday

1. **Birthday Number:** This number simply comes from the day you were born, reduced to a single digit if necessary. The Birthday Number tells you what traits you have in com-mon with people born on that day, no matter the month (see Chapter 9).
2. **Life Path Number:** This number is calculated using the month, day, and four-digit year you were born. Your Life Path Number gives you clues to your opportunities in life and what you may need to learn in order to accomplish your goals (see Chapter 10).
3. **Hidden Cross:** Adapted from the Chinese Lo Shu Square, the Hidden Cross is a graphic organizer resembling a tic-tac-toe grid. The digits of your birth month, day, and year are placed in specific squares. Each of the three horizontal rows and three vertical col-umns give detailed information about how you relate to others and explain your three levels of consciousness (see Chapter 10).
4. **Pinnacles and Challenges:** The four Pinnacles and their accompanying Challenges are derived from the month, day, and four-digit year of your birth. Pinnacles give you an overview of positive circumstances and events you may encounter during certain peri-ods of your life, whereas Challenges foretell potential bumps in the road you‚Äôll encounter in reaching your Pinnacles (see Chapter 11).
5. **Personal Year Number:** This number is calculated by using your birth month, birth date, and the year in which you last celebrated your birthday. Based on a nine-year cycle, the Personal Year Number indicates the inf luences for the year you‚Äôre in, and what you should or can do about it (see Chapter 12).
6. **Triad Numbers:** These numbers are calculated using your birth month, day of birth, the four-digit year in which you were born, the four-digit year in which you celebrated your last birthday, your age at your last birthday, and your Life Path Number. The Triad Numbers reveal more detailed information for each of the four-month periods within your Personal Year (see Chapter 13).&#x20;
7. **Personal Month Numbers:** To calculate these numbers, you need only the numeric value of the month in question and your Personal Year Number. Personal Month Numbers help you track how your feelings, attitudes, and circumstances change during the course of a Personal Year (see Chapter 14).
8. **Personal Day Number:** You calculate this by using your Personal Year Number and at least one month and day of interest to you. Your Personal Day Number can help you weigh decisions you want to or need to make on any given day (see Chapter 15)

== Secondary Numbers

### Secondary Numbers

There are additional numbers that have lesser import, either because they only impact for a short duration or during a specific part of your life. These numbers can provide insight to your more mature years, help you navigate some less-positive numbers, and detect worldwide trends by year.

The following are secondary numerology values you can use

1. **Maturity Number:** This number is calculated by adding your Life Path Number and your Destiny Number and reducing to a single digit if necessary. This number is meant for your middle-age years and gives hints about how to make the most of your ‚Äúgolden years‚Äù (see Chapter 16).
2. **Malefic Numbers:** These refer to the numbers 14, 16, and 19. You may see the Malefic Numbers as your calculations for your Core Numbers before you reduce them to a sin-gle digit, or they may be around you on addresses, license plates, and so on. Despite the name, these numbers aren‚Äôt inherently evil‚Äîthey just point to less positive aspects of your life (see Chapter 16).&#x20;
3. **Universal Year Number:** To calculate this, you simply add the digits of the current year. Known as the ‚Äúrhythm of the universe,‚Äù it describes the current year in general terms (see Chapter 16).

### Yearly Numbers

The important year numbers are just that‚Äîtime spans that are interesting in our lifetime. For example, they can refer to the year you graduated from college, made a major physical move, got married, changed careers, had a baby, and so on.

The following are important year numerology values you can find using your birth date:

1. **Milestone Years and Overtone Numbers:** Milestone Years are calculated by first tak-ing your four-digit birth year, reducing it to a single digit, and adding it to the full birth year. This gives you the first Milestone Year, which you can then reduce to a single digit and add to that year to get your next one, and so on. These tell you the significant years in your life. The Overtone Numbers are each of the single-digit numbers you get for the years (see Chapter 17)
2. **Highlight Year Number:** To calculate this, you add your age now to the age you‚Äôll be on your next birthday. This gives you an idea of how you‚Äôre progressing through life (see Chapter 17)
3. **Red-Letter Years:** Sometimes called Forecasting, you find these by taking your first, middle, and last names and adding the numeric value of the current letter to the numeric value of the previous letter. The Red-Letter Years are the ages in your life that are memorable or when something significant occurs (see Chapter 17)

### Interesting Notes

- Letters of the alphabet are associated with certain traits and characteristics.
- Letters have numerical values in numerology. The letter values in Pythagorean numerology are straightforward and cycle by nines, starting with A having a value of 1.
- When calculating values, continue to add the numbers until you‚Äôre left with a single-digit result.‚Ä¢ Numbers 1 through 9 each have a special meaning in numerology.
- Numerology can tell you everything from the milestone years in your life to what actions you should take on a certain day.

Fill in the cross by writing the NUMBERS of your birth date in their corresponding square. So for June 1st, you'd put a 6 in the 6 square, and a 1 in the 1 square.

### Hidden Cross Meanings

## **Pinnacles & Challenges**

### **Pinnacles & Challenges Age Windows**

To calculate the ages, you subtract your life path number from 36, so the first window (for me) is 36-4 which is 32, meaning my first window is 0yrs-32yrs, then you add +9 all the way up. Second window is 32-41, third is 41-50, and fourth is 50+

## Pythagoras' Tetractys

The Tetractys is one of the most interesting ideas in Pythagorean Number Theory, this also forms the basis for the Tarot of the Bohemians. The idea is that each layer represents one letter of the sacred name of God: YHVH

![](https://i.imgur.com/EOAq9ra.png)

### Row 1 - 0 Dimension - Point

Zero-Dimensions, a single point, or numerical value 1, no reduction possible.

### Row 2 - 1 Dimension - Line

One-Dimension, a line, the number 2, which has no reduction and the value of the Theosophical Addition is 3

$$
2=2+1=3
$$

### Row 3 - 2 Dimension - Plane

Two-Dimension, a plane with an X-axis and Y-axis, the number 3 with no reduction and the value of Theosophical Addition is 6

$$
3=3+2+1=6
$$

### Row 4 - 3 Dimension - Cube / Volumetric

Three-Dimensional manifestation, a pyramid or cube, the Theosophical Addition & Reduction returns back to the source of all numbers, the number 1

$$
4=4+3+2+1=10=1+0=1
$$

### The Final Row Representing Regeneration

The beauty comes when you realize that for every set of three consecutive numbers, the fourth acts as the start of a new set, as described in Tarot of the Bohemians:

1. Represents the Active, or Masculine
2. Represents the Passive, or Feminine
3. Represents the Neuter, or unity of 1 & 2
4. Represents the Active Regeneration, returns to the number 1
   1. As do: 7, 10, 13, 16, 19......

This represents the divine manifestation, as does the Tetractys and then the sacred name: YHVH

1. Active => Yod ( ◊ô )
2. Passive => 1st He ( ◊î )
3. Neuter => Vau ( ◊ï )
4. Active Regeneration => 2nd He ( ◊î )

### The Divine Code

Thus, quite literally, all numbers can be though of as an endless manifestation of YHVH.
