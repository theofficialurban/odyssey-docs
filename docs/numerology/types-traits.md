In the 1930s, some research numerologists, led by Dr. Juno Jordan, claimed that man is fourfold, with a body, brain, heart, and spirit. They discovered that letters and their corresponding num-bers can be grouped into four categories based on those ‚Äúplanes of expression,‚Äù as Dr. Jordan called them: physical, mental, emotional, and intuitive.&#x20;

### Physical Letters

<span style="color:red;">**Physical letters(4 and 5 number values)**</span> represent the body and are ruled by instinct. Concerned with the tangible and real, common sense is the keyword associated with the physical. The number of the worker and builder, 4 is economical and practical. The 5 value is less practical and suggests curiosity and security.

### Mental Letters

<span style="color:orange;">**Mental letters (1 and 8 number values)**</span> represent positive states of mind, analysis, reasoning, facts, executive ability, and leadership qualities. Determination is the keyword associated with the mental. These letters also suggest only accepting things that are obvious and can be proved. On the mental plane, 1 is the number of imagination and strong will. The 8 value is about control of the mind via practicality and logical reasoning.&#x20;

### Emotional Letters

<span style="color:blue;">**Emotional letters (2, 3, and 6 number values)**</span> represent the heart of man. Feeling is the key-word associated with the emotional‚Äîfacts give way to inspiration, imagination, and vision. The letters aren‚Äôt based on practical or logical foundations, but rather deal with sentiments over rea-son. They also represent feelings and imagination, as well as sympathetic and sensitive responses to human emotion. Sensitive to timing, 2 is the number of ideas and sharing love with others. The 3 value centers around imagination in relation to emotion, while 6 is the number of truth, beauty, and harmony.

### Intuitive Letters

<span style="color:purple;">**Intuitive letters (7 and 9 number values)**</span> represent the spiritual part of mankind that uses intuition to delve into the unknown and uses the ‚Äúinner guidance‚Äù to reach goals. Metaphysical is the keyword associated with the intuitive. Dealing with technical facts, 7 is about analysis and research. Deeply sensitive and imaginative, 9 works on a higher plane to impress the universe.

Think of the four categories as four levels of consciousness; the Type and Traits Chart delves deeper into those levels and shows how you are unique from others, looks at how you view life, and provides insight into your character. The Type and Traits Chart also looks at what talents and skills you were born with and what kind of work you might enjoy or be successful doing

## Chart Meanings

### Number of <span style="color:red;">Physical</span> letters

Having zero physical letters denotes a lack of physical endurance or a tendency to be impractical. If you have one physical letter, you‚Äôre apt to be active and enthu-siastic about life. Having two physical letters in your name indicates that although you may be sensitive, you are charming and clever. If you have three physical letters, you are imaginative, creative, and talented. Four physical letters denotes hard workers who are tenacious and can carry out their ideas to fruition. Those with five physical letters lead an active life and can be good salesman. If you have six physical letters, you accept responsibility readily and enjoy helping others. Those with seven physical letters delve deeply into things; although you‚Äôre friendly, you may not be very social. If you have eight physical letters, you‚Äôre ambitious and able to handle big projects with ease. Those with nine physical letters have a natural flair for drama and can achieve success in publishing or large corporations.

### Number of <span style="color:orange;">Mental</span> letters

If you have no mental letters in your name, you sometimes lack willpower and have difficulty making and sticking with your decisions. One mental letter indi-cates you can be witty and are an original thinker. Those with two mental letters are collectors of knowledge and things and are naturally agreeable and cooperative. If you have three mental letters in your name, you‚Äôre popular but prefer to make decisions on your own. Those with four mental letters are determined and have the ability to concentrate. If you have five mental letters in your name, you‚Äôre curious and enjoy having many irons in the fire simultaneously.

If you have seven mental letters, you‚Äôre observant and introspective, and require proof before you‚Äôre convinced of anything. Those with eight mental letters are ambitious and enjoy being in charge. If you have nine mental letters in your name, you enjoy working with people of diverse back-grounds and cultures.&#x20;

### Number of <span style="color:blue;">Emotional</span> letters

If you have no emotional letters in your name, you may have a difficult time expressing your emotions and may not be very empathetic of others‚Äô feelings. Having one emotional letter is apt to make you a bit high-strung yet capable of dealing with all kinds of people. If you have two emotional letters, you‚Äôre an intuitive and generous person who‚Äôs willing to share your possessions with others. Three emotional letters indicates you need an artistic outlet for your emotions and are gifted with words. Those with four emotional letters don‚Äôt like feeling restricted in their work or personal lives and need to be appreciated and validated by others. If you have five emotional letters in your name, you enjoy learning how others think and feel about various subjects. Those with six emotional letters are honest, feel things deeply, and tend to worry about others. If you have seven emotional letters in your name, you‚Äôre thoughtful and reserved, rarely expressing your emotions. Those with eight emotional letters have strong feelings and a strong need to excel. If you have nine emotional letters in your name, you enjoy receiving attention from others and may get pouty when you don‚Äôt receive the attention you crave

### Number of <span style="color:purple;">Intuitive</span> letters

If you have no intuitive letters in your name, you‚Äôre apt to lack interest in world affairs and prefer to see things in black and white rather than trusting impres-sions. Those who have one intuitive letter are inspired‚Äîsolutions and ideas come to you quickly. If you have two intuitive letters in your name, you may be a bit extreme in your thinking but are sensitive to the feelings of others. Three intuitive letters indicate you may get psychic hunches, have the ability to inspire others, and are good with words. If you have four intuitive letters, you tend to enjoy the ceremonies connected with religion or tradition and like facts more than fiction. Those with five intuitive letters can think outside the box, are curious, and like to know ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù If you have six intuitive letters in your name, you have high ideals and could succeed as a minister or in a creative profession. Those with seven intuitive letters are perfectionists and sometimes want to mold others the way they think they should be. If you have eight intuitive letters in your name, you have intuitive instincts and can excel as a researcher or historian. It is not only unlikely, but almost impossible, to have nine intuitive letters in your name; however, if you‚Äôre the one in a million who happens to have nine intuitive letters, you‚Äôre a very unique person. You dwell in the abstract, are highly impressionable, and are a dreamer rather than a doer.
