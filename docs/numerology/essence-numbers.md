== #1

## Essence Number 1&#x20;

This is a lucky time for new directions, new ideas, new contacts, new occupations, new enter-prises, and new environments. Your leadership skills are important, and a change where your job is concerned (perhaps a promotion or other advancement) is likely during this time. You may also be called upon to make an important decision based on an event thatâ€™s occurring in your life now. Perhaps youâ€™re offered a sizeable promotion but accepting it would require you to move to another state, or youâ€™re happy living in your home and a real estate agent knocks on your front door and tells you her client wants to pay you $1 million in cash for your home. Be sure to keep your bags packed, as this is a time for quick getaways or extended vacations.&#x20;

### Hidden Essence Number 10

This period brings improvement in all areas of your life. Youâ€™re going to feel bolder and more confident, which corresponds to your new wave of ambition during this period. You also have more decisions to make, and are able to overcome difficulties and carry out your plans to fruition. During this period, remain open to new friendshipsâ€”they may be beneficial down the road. Also, you may be separated from your loved ones for a short period of time due to personal or professional obligations. During this Hidden Essence Number, you may be hearing about or dealing with children, either your own or those of relatives or close friends

### Hidden Essence Number 19

This period likely brings some type of advancement for you. Although you may experience a bit of trouble or discord, money is going to find its way to you in some way. And while youâ€™re presented with multiple opportunities, itâ€™s best if you consult a professional before making a decision on your own. Marriage is involved under this number, so you may get married, improve your relationship, or part ways at this time. Your temper may run high during this period, so think of the other person, remember the Golden Rule, and avoid act-ing selfishly. Your character is also tested during this period; if you take the high road, Essence Number 19 brings honor, advancement, happiness, and success.

### Hidden Essence Number 28

This Hidden Essence Number has many contradictions and involves the learning of important life lessons. This may be a period of legal difficulty, so be wary of trusting others you donâ€™t know well and entering into new business partnerships. Youâ€™re espe-cially prone to financial losses during this period, so this isnâ€™t the time to make investments. In your desire for change, be careful with whom you become involved. You may have to or choose to start your life over during this period with a new marriage, job, or home.

### Hidden Essence Number 37

This is a fortunate number that promotes friendship and love. Partnerships of all kindsâ€”whether business or personalâ€”are favorable now. In your personal life, romance abounds. During a Hidden Essence Number 37, business profits should be plentiful, pro-vided you use ordinary caution regarding the source of the profits. You also experience a sense of peaceful contentment; the outlook is good for a rosy future

== #2

## Essence Number 2

Cooperation and patience are essential to your success during this periodâ€”thereâ€™s no need to rush. Donâ€™t hesitate to accept help from others when offered. Itâ€™s also important for you to maintain a positive outlook and a good disposition at this time. Pay attention to the details nowâ€”there are a lot of loose ends to be tied up and many little tasks to be accomplished

### Hidden Essence Number 11

This is an important Hidden Essence Number that can bring many lessons to be learned. Patience needs to be used in all of your relationships and business affairs. Donâ€™t be surprised if thereâ€™s a sudden break-up, crisis, or emotional shock to deal with during this time. For example, you may hear of an illness of a relative, so be prepared to lend a helping hand. Thereâ€™s a sense of suddenness in many of your dealings, which may lead you to unexpectedly enter or exit a relationship. Take the time to develop inner peace nowâ€”be still, listen to your heart, and know. Be careful of deceit, illusion, and delusion from others

### Hidden Essence Number 20

This is not a time for dreams or fanciful thoughtsâ€”this is a time for action. Keep your eye on the future as you progress through this period, and understand that you may face judgment, obstacles, and delays along your path. Relationships and companionship may also be on your mind now. Take the time to rest, and be especially aware of low energy or other symptoms that could signal a hidden illness. This is a period of change, with many ups and downs, making it a good time to study something of a mystical or religious nature. Keep your bags packed, because short pleasure trips are apt to be on your agenda.

### Hidden Essence Number 29

During this Hidden Essence Number, you are cautioned to avoid deception, deceit, and dishonesty from others. Be careful of the friends and romantic compan-ions you choose, because what appears on the surface may not be reality. Uncertainties and unexpected dangers come from dealing with romantic partners at this time, as thereâ€™s a chance the love isnâ€™t genuine. You also may feel compelled to visit ailing friends or family members at this time, which likely leads to physical and emotional exhaustion. Try to dissipate your nervous energy during this period through exercise or a hobby

== #3

## Essence Number 3

This is a period filled with social activities, friends, and the problems of those friends. Inclined to expand your horizons now, youâ€™re apt to take a trip to study history or cultures. You may have an increased desire to workâ€”not because you have to, but rather because you desire the company of others. A little extra income to improve your surroundings wonâ€™t hurt, though. Be cautious of your finances during this time, and avoid reckless spending of money. During this period, you may be especially focused on the immediate rather than the future, which could lead to a hasty marriage. Be conscientious and fulfill all obligations during this period, as doing so could garner you a raise or put you in a position of authority. Not only do you give orders during an Essence Number 3, you also expect others to follow your orders, which may or may not happen

### Hidden Essence Number 12

This Hidden Essence Number is a peculiar number, in that it involves a woman a little bit older and a little bit smarter than you. Unfortunately, you struggle in your dealings with her. This isnâ€™t a time to acknowledge past regrets and mistakesâ€”move on and let old feelings go. To avoid feeling anxious, use your creative imagination and plan for your future. While you may take trips for pleasure, be careful when choosing your traveling com-panions to avoid gossip or scandal. Also, be cautious when choosing confidants and avoid false friendsâ€”look below the surface and listen to whatâ€™s not being said. While you may be inclined to make amends now, be sure the other party is willing to listen and accept your apology with the spirit in which it is given. Youâ€™re able to express your ideas in writing or speaking during this period, and doing so may lead to career advancement. Hearing about or dealing with childrenâ€”either yours or those of someone close to youâ€”may be involved during the Hidden Essence Year Number 12.

### Hidden Essence Number 21

This Hidden Essence Number is a mystical number that rep-resents the highest goal to which people aim. You have a happy-go-lucky attitude during this period, in spite of the emotional ups and downs and disappointments that appear here and there. During this time, you need to correct any mistakes youâ€™ve made in your recent past. Itâ€™s time to stand on your own two feet and be courageous and determined in whatever you undertake. Also, be generous yet businesslike in all of your affairs. Youâ€™re apt to yield to your business partner or spouse, setting aside your own desires to keep the peace. During this time, focus on yourself and what youâ€™re doing, rather than being concerned with what others are doing. This is also an excel-lent time to follow artistic or creative pursuits, whether itâ€™s studying plants for making perfume or preparing and presenting food

### Hidden Essence Number 30

This Hidden Essence Number brings opportunities for advance-ment in your career and romantic life. During this period, youâ€™re going to have many irons in the fire on a mental level, allowing you to pursue many business opportunities simultaneously. Also, if youâ€™ve been advised to have surgery, this is the perfect time to do so. If a health issue arises, itâ€™s likely not a serious problem and usually involves the mouth, throat, or tongue. You feel superior to others around you during this time and are apt to put any desires for monetary gain aside for the time being

== #4

## Essence Number 4

This is a time to be conscientious and get your life and affairs in proper order. During this period, unknown facts come to light regarding a situation that has been puzzling you. Even though your life may seem to be moving at a snailâ€™s pace, be responsible and keep your nose to the grindstone to see positive results near the end of this period. Even if you feel restricted or limited, thereâ€™s work to be done, so do it! Also, be aware that relatives or in-laws may make demands on your time and pocketbook during this period. Now is a good time to schedule a checkup and maintain good health habits. Even if you feel melancholy or lonely during this time, try not to be too sensi-tive or get your feelings hurt.

### Hidden Essence Number 13

This Hidden Essence Number brings complications that can be solved by responsibility and hard work. Itâ€™s a period of change, both big and small. On the job front, you could be transferred to a higher position with more responsibility. At home, you could have an extended visitor or even move. Youâ€™re also faced with many demands from relatives, including lots of tasks for you to complete for them, during this period. Law prevails now, making it probable that youâ€™re going to receive a settlement of some kind or that you need to go to court. Donâ€™t despair if the settlement isnâ€™t as much as you wanted or expectedâ€”everything will work out for the best in the long run. You may also feel as if youâ€™re being held down by someone or something beyond your control at this timeâ€”have patience.

### Hidden Essence Number 22

This Hidden Essence warns of illusions and delusions. Be cautious of false friends and bad advice. In your desire to help others, you may find yourself dissatisfied or upset. Take great care in making decisions during this period, because youâ€™ll likely regret your poor choices later. If youâ€™re required to work in a way that you feel is beneath you, try to avoid resentment. You may also experience some form of disappointment where money is concerned during this time. Practice moderation and financial responsibilityâ€”for example, by paying your bills on time. Youâ€™re apt to hear of the usual run-of-the-mill illness of a child around you, which is nothing to be worried about. This is also the time to improve yourself and not be concerned with the activities and actions of others.

### Hidden Essence Number 31

During this period, you may be inclined to spend time alone and isolate yourself more than usual. Also, finances are important nowâ€”you could receive money through the sale of land, real estate, or other material property. You may even collect from some sort of settlement, such as an inheritance, insurance claim, or legal matter. Even though youâ€™re self-contained and self-content now, make sure to avoid being selfish

== #5

## Essence Number 5

This is a busy period, with lots of activity; you may feel as if youâ€™re being pushed in one direction and pulled from another. There may be a tendency to leave things unfinished and procrastinate during this time, as you often drop or defer uninteresting responsibilities for something more enjoyable and exciting. You also have a strong desire to be constantly moving and are inclined to take short trips during this period. Follow the laws of the land at this time. Heed the speed limits and pay particular attention when preparing your taxes; otherwise, youâ€™re likely to get caught!

### Hidden Essence Number 14

This Hidden Essence Number is the number of transition and continual excitement. When you have nervous energy, slow down and donâ€™t run around in circles, accomplishing nothing. Also, avoid quarrels that could lead to legal troubles and separations. Now is an excellent time to use your progressive ideas to create new projects and pursue new interests. When youâ€™re honest, investments and sound entrepreneurial ventures can be especially fruitful during this time. Use sound judgment when choosing companions and friends, because you may be especially trusting and even gullible now.

### Hidden Essence Number 23

Youâ€™re filled with cleverness and quickness of thought during this period; you should find that learning comes easily now. Things happen suddenly during this time, so be ready for love at first sight, a marriage, or other quick impulses and actions. Be on the lookout, as some unexpected happenings may be quite unusual. Also, you receive help from people in high positions during this period. While thereâ€™s much talk about changes youâ€™d like to make, itâ€™s more talk than action right now. Youâ€™re tuned in to the Universe at this time, and many things seem interesting to you. Be sure to keep your bags packed during Hidden Essence Number 23, as you may take long journeys.

### Hidden Essence Number 32

During this period, you find yourself working with groups to bet-ter mankind. Listen carefully to your inner voice and make your own plans. Be careful to keep your plans to yourself so the naysayers canâ€™t discourage you. Youâ€™re going to meet fascinating people who bring you many advantageous social connections during this period. Able to move easily from one occupation to another, you may even conduct business in a foreign land. At this time, avoid becoming involved in scandalous love affairs or a love triangle

== #6

## Essence Number 6

This time focuses on family, loved ones, and small animals. After years of hard work, your inter-est turns to love, home, family, and the appearance of your home surroundings. This is not a time for arguments or disagreements of any kindâ€”rather, itâ€™s a time for peace and quiet, being surrounded by beautiful things, and being considerate of others. Your business and financial mat-ters improve during this period and some form of financial gain will come from a member of the opposite sex. During this period, you may be saddled with unexpected expenses for medical, dental, or even veterinary care for your family, whether human or pet. Also, beware of an overly dominant, inconsiderate, and possessive person whoâ€™s sure to bring you unhappiness at this time. Popularity, recognition, standing in your community, and a pleasant social life is your reward for service to others now.

### Hidden Essence Number 15

This is a time of finance; money often comes easily right now, but you have unexpected expenses that require you to spend what comes in. Although you have many admirers, you may experience some difficulties when dealing with the opposite sex. During this period, you also may find that you or your partner is overly interested in family and not pay-ing attention to the spouse. If youâ€™ve helped someone in the past, this is the time to collect favors in return. Climb the career ladder of success now by giving 100 percent of yourself and accepting more than your share of responsibility.

### Hidden Essence Number 24

This is a number that signals good fortune. Because youâ€™re spend-ing so much time helping your family, you may find less time and freedom for yourself. Thereâ€™s also a chance of inheritance during this time; it may come from a grateful relative whom you have helped in the past or through the appreciation or kindness of others. Not one to be a social climber, you likely profit from your associations with influential members of the opposite sex. Be especially careful and alert so you can avoid accidents during this period.

### Hidden Essence Number 33

This Hidden Essence Number is a beautiful period filled with love, kindness, friendship, understanding, and peaceful relationships. You likely welcome many visitors to your home during this period and may experience household upheaval, such as a change of residence or someone leaving your home. Being dignified and trustworthy now will reap you rewards in the future

== #7

## Essence Number 7

This is the time to delve into the mysteries of life, psychic experiences, or metaphysical studies. During this period, you experience many serendipitous experiences that cause you to reevalu-ate your beliefs about life. Open your intellectual interests to new experiences that employ a finer use of your talents. Literary or educational pursuits can bring much success and advancement in your career. During this time, you should also give very careful consideration to the chance for long-term happiness with your prospective mate before walking down the aisle. If youâ€™re married or in a relationship, a period of trouble and struggle may arise at this time. This is a good time to take control of your thoughts and emotions to ensure more happiness in your life

### Hidden Essence Number 16

This is a period of change for you, so be ready for your plans to change on a whim. If you feel as if your life is falling to pieces during this period, rest assured that itâ€™s actually falling into place. This is a time of karmic tests and mental reevaluations. You may find that scientific work, technology, research, law, or other fields of study are of particular interest to you now. If you experience disappointments in love or marriage, rest assured that any trouble experienced under a Hidden Essence Number 16 never lasts longâ€”this, too, shall pass. This is also a time to tend to your health and pay special attention to avoid careless accidents or slip-and-falls. If you happen to be around people who have had too much to drink during this time, offer to be the designated driver. Expect to hear unusual news during this period, as you are a confidante to many at this time

### Hidden Essence Number 25

During this Hidden Essence Number, youâ€™re able to read the minds of those around you and are especially in tune to psychic experiences. You also find this is a period of strange occurrences. Powers of keen observation and imitation are yours now; you acquire inner knowledge that can help you solve any difficulties that you may encounter. Also, be ready to take a trip over or near the water at this timeâ€”at the very least, you could learn to swim.

### Hidden Essence Number 34

This period is surrounded with mystery, as is everyone you wel-come into your existence at this time. Staying in the background and shunning publicity is advisable now. Following the rules and acting in a conventional manner can bring you more success during this time. It may seem as if something interrupts your plans or that thereâ€™s an obstacle to everything you undertake now. You also may need to deal with the illness of your parents or some member of your family, or may be separated from them for a period of time. Take extra care during this period to prevent accidents. You may be involved in discussions or disagreements about religion now. Also, this period is excellent for musical pursuitsâ€”especially singingâ€”or other educational studies.

== #8

## Essence Number 8

This number is one of power and authority. Expect to find yourself in leadership positions or financial affairs that use your executive skills to organize activities or be in control of situations. This number also is involved with buying, selling, exchanging, or renting of property. Money can be earned during this period, but be advised that expenses usually are similar to your income, so be sure to balance the budget before writing checks. Monetary gain could also come through some form of sports. During this time, better results are gained when working in groups rather than by yourself.

### Hidden Essence Number 17

During this period, you are going to rise above petty differences in life and be poised, powerful, and prosperous. This is a time to pay great attention to detail and use your powers of intuition. Now is also a time to be wise in all of your decision-making. Expect money to come to you via checks, either from a pay increase, insurance, stocks, or bonds that pay good interest. This is a time for secret investigations or being a super sleuth to gather the infor-mation you need. Take care to avoid being judgmental of others right now. Also, be ready to take important journeys either near or on water.

### Hidden Essence Number 26

During this Hidden Essence Number, you have many small duties to attend to but can make gains in business through networking and association with others. You have executive ability and can manage multiple projects during this period. Able to speak with power and conviction, you can reach others with your words and messages now. Birds of a feather flock together, so take care when choosing your companions. Also, be cautious about any get-rich-quick schemesâ€”if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Itâ€™s probable that youâ€™re going to be paying out financially for others right now, leaving less for you to be self-indulgent. This is a time to keep your emotions on an even keel.

### Hidden Essence Number 35

During this time, youâ€™re going to ride the wave of all the good in your life. Success comes easily to you now and may even bring a monetary inheritance your way. This is a period of social opportunities, activities, and help from friends. On the business side, youâ€™re presented with money-making opportunities, new work, ideas, interests, and investments now. Also, expect to travel for both business and pleasure during this period

== #9

## Essence Number 9

This number provides many blessings in disguise, as long as you possess a tolerant, compassion-ate frame of mind during this period. These years are a time of deep feelings and drama, where you must avoid being possessive. But on the flip side of the coin, you may enjoy love affairs or romance of some sort. You may experience a loss during this time, but rest assured that it will make way for something bigger and better in your life. Remember that everything happens for a reason. Big business, government dealings, and the acquisition of money can be yours during this time. To avoid being involved in legal matters, strict honesty is essential in all transactions. Quarrels, arguments, or legal matters can be long and drawn out, so itâ€™s best to avoid them altogether

### Hidden Essence Number 18

This Hidden Essence Number is interesting, because youâ€™re deal-ing with big corporations, lawyers who may straighten out a will or inheritance, doctors, or dentists for yourself or a family member. Money acquisition to the point of greediness shouldnâ€™t be your sole purpose in life during this period. Although others may be bickering or arguing around you, avoid getting involved in petty disagreements or bitterness. Be careful of your emotions and friendships nowâ€”thereâ€™s someone who isnâ€™t worthy of your friendship, time, or good-natured personality. Be on guard and pay attention to your intuition to detect the motives of others. During this period, be sure to watch traffic lights and follow all rules of the road, or youâ€™re sure to get a ticket. Also, be careful of accidents caused by the carelessness of others.

### Hidden Essence Number 27

During this period, use your strength and reasoning to plan for yourself rather than listening to the opinion of others. This is the time to work with the public, give speeches, and create literary triumphs. Art, music, beauty, peace, and justice are part of your world now, so avoid intolerance and bigotry in all forms. If youâ€™re unable to do or accomplish all you want to do right now, avoid feeling disappointed. Itâ€™s also best to sidestep extra work at this time to protect your good health. If you experience disappointments in love affairs, pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and realize that there are more fish in the sea. Short and long journeys are especially beneficial during this time.

### Hidden Essence Number 36

During this Hidden Essence Number, you have the power to overcome ordinary obstacles and experience eventual success. You may be especially generous and sympathetic now, with a strong desire to help those less fortunate. Use all of your talents in a constructive manner at this time, and youâ€™ll receive many benefits in return
