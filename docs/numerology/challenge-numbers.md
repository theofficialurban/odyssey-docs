## Challenge Numbers

### Challenge Number 0

If you have a Challenge Number of 0, metaphysicians believe you‚Äôre an old soul who either has no challenges or has already experienced Challenge Numbers 1 through 8 in this and past life-times. So, in the words of Tony Soprano, ‚ÄúFuggetaboutit‚Äù‚Äîyou have it made in the shade

### Challenge Number 1

Circumstances require you to be independent and stand up for yourself without being domineer-ing. Don‚Äôt be afraid to express your individuality. Learn to not only value but also voice your original ideas. Also, be self-reliant and don‚Äôt expect others to help you. Avoid criticizing others simply because they are different from you. Accept responsibility for your actions, and don‚Äôt pass the buck.

### Challenge Number 3

Circumstances require you to use your imagination, creativity, and artistic or musical talents. Have more confidence in yourself and your abilities but temper your confidence with an ability to accept constructive criticism. Use your gift of words to express yourself but avoid using hurt-ful words when speaking with others. Be as interested in others as you are in yourself‚Äîdon‚Äôt hog the limelight.&#x20;

### Challenge Number 4

Circumstances require you to develop a code of ethics and a sense of values. Learn to focus on a project until it‚Äôs completed. Realize you need to work to have financial security. Tone down your strong opinions, and allow others to voice theirs. Be more patient and use good judgment.

### Challenge Number 5

Circumstances require you to be more curious and ask questions. Learn to be more flexible and less set in your ways. Enjoy your freedom without shirking your responsibilities. Avoid being so restless and impatient. Allow yourself to have more fun, try something new, and take a risk now and then.

### Challenge Number 6

Circumstances require you to accept responsibility for your own actions. Learn to appreciate others more and enjoy giving without having strings attached. Be realistic in your idealism‚Äîdon‚Äôt set yourself up for disappointment by putting others on pedestals. Be honorable and learn to fulfill your commitments.

### Challenge Number 7

Circumstances require you to overcome your feelings of loneliness and transform them into feel-ings of gratitude. Accept obstacles when faced with them‚Äîrealize this is a time of inner growth and spiritual development. Don‚Äôt allow false pride to get in the way of your happiness.

### Challenge Number 8

Circumstances require you to be sincere and avoid being boastful. Learn to empower others instead of taking charge most of the time. Be willing to work for material success‚Äîthere‚Äôs more to life than a hefty back balance. Pay more attention to your health and diet and find balance in all areas of your life, especially where emotions are concerned
