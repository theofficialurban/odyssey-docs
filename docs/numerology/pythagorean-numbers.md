# üî¢ Pythagorean Number Symbolism

[[toc]]

## Numerical Symbolism

### Number 1

Not surprisingly, the number 1 is generally treated as a [symbol](https://www.britannica.com/topic/symbol) of unity. Therefore, in monotheistic religions, it often symbolizes God or the universe. The Pythagoreans did not consider 1 to be a number at all because number means plurality and 1 is singular. However, they considered it to be the source of all numbers because adding many 1s together can create any other (positive whole) number. In their system, where odd numbers were male and even numbers female, the number 1 was neither; instead, it changed each to the other. If 1 is added to an even number, it becomes odd; similarly, if 1 is added to an odd number, it becomes even.

### Number 2

The number 2 symbolizes many of the basic dualities: me/you, male/female, yes/no, alive/dead, left/right, [yin/yang](https://www.britannica.com/topic/yinyang), and so on. [Dualities](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/Dualities) are common in human approaches to the world, probably because of our preference for two-valued logic‚Äîyet another duality, true/false. Although 2 was female to the Pythagoreans, other numerological schemes viewed it as male. In [Agrippa von Nettesheim](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Heinrich-Cornelius-Agrippa-von-Nettesheim)‚Äôs _De occulta philosophia_ (1533; ‚ÄúOn the Philosophy of the Occult‚Äù), 2 is the symbol for man, sex, and evil. One reason that some have associated 2 with evil is that the biblical book of [Genesis](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Genesis-Old-Testament) does not use the formula ‚Äúand it was good‚Äù when referring to the second day of Creation.

Some religions are dualistic, with two gods in place of the one God of monotheism. Examples include [Zoroastrianism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Zoroastrianism), where [Ahura MazdƒÅ](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ahura-Mazda) (the god of light and goodness) battles with [Ahriman](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ahriman) (the god of darkness and evil). The number 2 is often associated with negatives, as in the words _duplicity_ and _two-faced_. [Northwest Coast Indian](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Northwest-Coast-Indian)s required the parents of twins to observe various [taboos](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/taboos) because they believed that supernatural powers would bring the wishes of twins to fruition.

### Number 3

The number 3 is a very mystical and spiritual number featured in many folktales (three wishes, three guesses, three little pigs, three bears, three billy goats gruff). In ancient Babylon the three primary gods were [Anu](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Anu), Bel ([Baal](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Baal-ancient-deity)), and [Ea](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ea), representing Heaven, Earth, and the Abyss. Similarly, there were three aspects to the Egyptian sun god: Khepri (rising), [Re](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Re) (midday), and [Atum](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Atum) (setting). In Christianity there is the [Trinity](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Trinity-Christianity) of God the Father, God the Son, and God the [Holy Spirit](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Holy-Spirit). Plato saw 3 as being symbolic of the [triangle](https://www.britannica.com/science/triangle-mathematics), the simplest spatial shape, and considered the world to have been built from triangles. In German [folklore](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/folklore) a paper triangle with a [cross](https://www.britannica.com/topic/cross-religious-symbol) in each corner and a prayer in the middle was thought to act as protection against gout, as well as protecting a cradle from witches. Three black animals were often sacrificed when attempting to conjure up demons. On the other hand, a three-coloured cat was a protective spirit. In [William Shakespeare](https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Shakespeare)‚Äôs [_Macbeth_](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Macbeth-by-Shakespeare) (1606‚Äì07) there are three witches, and their spell begins, ‚ÄúThrice the brindled cat hath mewed,‚Äù reflecting such superstitions. Also, 3 is the dimension of the smallest [magic square](https://www.britannica.com/topic/magic-square) in which every row, column, and diagonal sums to 15.

### Number 4

The number of order in the universe is 4‚Äîthe four elements of earth, air, fire, and water; the four seasons; the four points of the compass; the four phases of the Moon (new, half-moon waxing, full, half-moon waning). The [Four Noble Truths](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Four-Noble-Truths) epitomize Buddhism. To the Pythagoreans 4 was the source of the tetractys 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10, the most [perfect number](https://www.britannica.com/science/perfect-number). In [medieval](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/medieval) times there were thought to be four [humour](https://www.britannica.com/science/humor-ancient-physiology)s (phlegm, blood, choler, and black bile‚Äîhence the adjectives _phlegmatic_, _sanguine_, _choleric_, and _melancholic_), and the body was bled at various places to bring these humours into balance.

The number 4 is central in the world view of the [Sioux](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sioux), with four groups of gods (superior, ally, subordinate, and spirit), four types of animal (creeping, flying, four-legged, and two-legged), and four ages of humans (infant, child, mature, and elderly). Their medicine men instructed them to carry out all activities in groups of four.

Because 4 is generally a practical, material number, few superstitions are associated with it. An exception is in China, where 4 is unlucky because _she_ (‚Äúfour‚Äù) and _shi_ (‚Äúdeath‚Äù) sound similar. In the biblical [Revelation to John](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Revelation-to-John) the [Four Horsemen](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Four-Horsemen) of the [Apocalypse](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Apocalypse) wreak destruction upon humanity.

### Number 5

The sum of the first even and odd numbers (2 + 3) is 5. (To the Pythagoreans 1 was not a number and was not odd.) It therefore symbolizes human life and‚Äîin the [Platonic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Platonic) and Pythagorean traditions‚Äîmarriage, as the sum of the female 2 and the male 3. The Pythagoreans discovered the five regular solids (tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron; now known as the [Platonic solid](https://www.britannica.com/science/Platonic-solid)s). Early Pythagoreanism acknowledged only four of these, so the discovery of the fifth (the dodecahedron, with 12 pentagonal faces) was something of an embarrassment. Perhaps for this reason 5 was often considered exotic and rebellious.

The number 5 was associated with the Babylonian goddess [Ishtar](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ishtar-Mesopotamian-goddess) and her Roman parallel, [Venus](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Venus-goddess), and the symbol for both was the five-pointed star, or [pentagram](https://www.britannica.com/topic/pentagram). In England a knot tied in the form of the [pentagram](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/pentagram) is called a lover‚Äôs knot because of this association with the goddess of love. In [Manichaeism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Manichaeism) 5 has a central position: the first man had five sons; there are five elements of light (ether, wind, water, light, and fire) and a further five of darkness. The body has five parts; there are five virtues and five vices.

The number 5 was also important to the [Maya](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Maya-people), who placed a fifth point at the centre of the four points of the compass. The five fingers of the human hand lent a certain mystery to 5, as did the five extremities of the body (two arms, two legs, head). A human placed in a circle with outspread arms and legs approximates the five points of a pentagon, and if each point is joined to its second nearest neighbour, a pentagram results. This geometric figure is central to occultism, and it plays a prominent role in summoning spells whereby it is supposed to trap a demon, or devil, who can then be compelled to do the sorcerer‚Äôs bidding. The belief that 5 was sacred led to an extra element, augmenting the traditional four that made a [human being](https://www.britannica.com/topic/human-being). This fifth essence, or [quintessence](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/quintessence), is the origin of the word _quintessential_.

In [Islam](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Islam) 5 is a sacred number. Foremost are the five [Pillars of Islam](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pillars-of-Islam): declaration of faith ([_shahƒÅdah_](https://www.britannica.com/topic/shahadah)), prayer ([_·π£alƒÅt_](https://www.britannica.com/topic/salat)), fasting during [Ramadan](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ramadan), giving alms ([_zakƒÅt_](https://www.britannica.com/money/zakat-Islamic-tax)), and making the pilgrimage to Mecca (the [hajj](https://www.britannica.com/topic/hajj)). Prayers are said five times every day. There are five categories of [Islamic law](https://www.britannica.com/topic/sharia) and five law-giving prophets ([Noah](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Noah), [Abraham](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Abraham), [Moses](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Moses-Hebrew-prophet), [Jesus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jesus), and [Muhammad](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Muhammad)).

### Number 6

By a wonderful conjunction of mathematical coincidences, 6 is both the sum (1 + 2 + 3) and the product (1 √ó 2 √ó 3) of the first three numbers. It is therefore considered ‚Äúperfect.‚Äù In mathematics, a [perfect number](https://www.britannica.com/science/perfect-number) is one that equals the sum of its divisors (excluding itself), and 6 is the first perfect number in this sense because its divisors are 1, 2, and 3. The next perfect number is 28. No odd perfect numbers are known, but it has not been proved that none exists. The perfection of 6 shows up in the six days of Creation in [Genesis](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/Genesis), with God resting on the seventh day. The structure of the Creation parallels the sum 1 + 2 + 3: on day 1 light is created; on days 2 and 3 heaven and earth appear; finally, on days 4, 5, and 6 all living creatures are created.

### Number 7

The sum of the spiritual 3 and the material 4 is 7. In [medieval](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/medieval) education, students pursued the trivium (grammar, [rhetoric](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rhetoric), and logic) and the quadrivium (music, arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy), a total of seven subjects, collectively known as the [liberal arts](https://www.britannica.com/topic/liberal-arts). Pythagorean interest in the mathematical patterns in music gives 7 a privileged role, for there are seven distinct notes in the musical scale‚Äîcorresponding roughly to the white notes on a piano. Counting from 1, the eighth note up the scale is the exceedingly harmonious octave, which is how the name arose.

The number 7 is often considered lucky, and it has a definite mystique, perhaps because it is a prime number‚Äîthat is, it cannot be obtained by multiplying two smaller numbers together. There are seven days of the week, named after various ancient gods and planets (Sun-day, Moon-day, Tiw‚Äôs-day, Woden‚Äôs-day, Thor‚Äôs-day, Frigg‚Äôs-day, Saturn-day). Tiw was a Norse god of war, parallel to [Mars](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mars-Roman-god) in role but to [Zeus](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Zeus) in [etymology](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/etymology), and [Frigg](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Frigg-Norse-mythology) was the Old English version of Frea (or Freya), wife of Woden (= [Odin](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Odin-Norse-deity)).

Shakespeare wrote of the seven ages of man, an idea that goes back much earlier. In China 7 determines the stages of female life: a girl gets her ‚Äúmilk teeth‚Äù at seven months, loses them at seven years, reaches puberty at 2 √ó 7 = 14 years, and reaches menopause at 7 √ó 7 = 49. The phases of the Moon last approximately seven days, with 4 √ó 7 = 28 days in a month and also in a female menstrual period. Many [cultures](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cultures) recognized seven planets (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) in the sense of ‚Äúwandering bodies,‚Äù unlike the ‚Äúfixed stars,‚Äù which retain the same relative position in the night sky. The seven candles of the Jewish [menorah](https://www.britannica.com/topic/menorah) that burned in the [Tabernacle](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tabernacle) symbolized the Creation and, according to the English scholar [Robert Graves](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-James-Graves), may be connected to the seven planets of antiquity.

In [ancient Egypt](https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Egypt) there were seven paths to heaven and seven heavenly cows; [Osiris](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Osiris-Egyptian-god) led his father through seven halls of the underworld. The [seven deadly sins](https://www.britannica.com/topic/seven-deadly-sins) are well-known in Christian tradition. The number 7 was the fundamental number of the [Rosicrucians](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Rosicrucians), who used it as an organizational basis for their text _Chymische Hochzeit Christiani Rosenkreutz_ (1459; _Alchemical Wedding of Christian Rosycross_). The number was also central to the cult of [Mithra](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mithra), which believed the soul rose to paradise through seven planetary spheres. The Christian idea of seven layers of [purgatory](https://www.britannica.com/topic/purgatory-Roman-Catholicism) may be related.

The number 7 features prominently in folk sayings. Breaking a mirror leads to seven years of bad luck. In Iran a cat has seven lives, not the nine of Western [myth](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/myth).

The most common numbers in the Indian [Vedas](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Veda) are 3 and 7. [Agni](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Agni), the god of fire, has seven wives, mothers, or sisters and can produce seven flames. The [sun god](https://www.britannica.com/topic/sun-worship) has seven horses to pull his heavenly chariot. In the [Rigveda](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Rigveda) there are seven parts of the world, seven seasons, and seven heavenly fortresses. The cow has 21 = 3 √ó 7 names.

In the Hippocratic tradition of medicine, 7 rules the illnesses of the body, with painful illnesses lasting 7, 14, or 21 days. In Germany it was believed that pigs would not contract [hog cholera](https://www.britannica.com/science/hog-cholera) if they were treated for seven days with water containing asphodel. In Jewish magic a fever can be cured by taking seven prickles from seven palm trees, seven chips from seven beams, seven nails from seven bridges, seven ashes from seven ovens‚Ä¶terminating in seven hairs from the beard of an old dog.

### Number 8

The number 8 is generally considered to be an [auspicious](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/auspicious) number by numerologists. The square of any odd number, less one, is always a multiple of 8 (for example, 9 ‚àí 1 = 8, 25 ‚àí 1 = 8 √ó 3, 49 ‚àí 1 = 8 √ó 6), a fact that can be proved mathematically. In Babylonian myth there were seven spheres plus an eighth realm, the fixed stars, where the gods lived. As a result, 8 is often associated with paradise. Muslims believe that there are seven hells but eight paradises, signifying God‚Äôs mercy. In Buddhism 8 is a lucky number, possibly because of the eight petals of the lotus, a plant associated with luck in India and a favourite Buddhist [symbol](https://www.britannica.com/topic/symbol).

In China, just as the number 7 determines the life of a woman, 8 determines that of a man. A boy gets his milk teeth at eight months, loses them at eight years, reaches puberty at 2 √ó 8 = 16, and loses sexual virility at 8 √ó 8 = 64. The [_Yijing_](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Yijing), which describes a system of [divination](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/divination) using yarrow stalks, involves 64 = 8 √ó 8 configurations.

### Number 9

In contrast to 8, the number 9 often represents pain or sadness. The 16th-century Catholic theologian Peter Bungus pointed out that the Ninth Psalm predicts the coming of the Antichrist. In Islamic cosmology the universe is made from nine spheres‚Äîthe traditional eight of [Ptolemy](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ptolemy), plus a ninth added by the Arab astronomer [ThƒÅbit ibn Qurrah](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thabit-ibn-Qurrah) about 900 CE to explain the [precession of the equinoxes](https://www.britannica.com/science/precession-of-the-equinoxes).

In Anglo-Saxon cultures 9 crops up frequently. The early inhabitants of Wales used nine steps to measure distance in legal contexts; for example, a dog that has bitten someone can be killed if it is nine steps away from its owner‚Äôs house, and nine people assaulting one [constituted](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/constituted) a genuine attack. In German law the ownership of land terminated after the ninth generation. Many folk sayings involve the number 9. A stitch in time saves nine. Cloud nine is the ultimate in happiness. A cat has nine lives. In [Greek mythology](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Greek-mythology) the River Styx, across which souls were ferried to the underworld, is described as having nine twists.

### Number 10

As already stated, 10 was the Pythagorean symbol of perfection or completeness. Humans have ten fingers and ten toes. Counting on fingers probably led to the [decimal number system](https://www.britannica.com/science/decimal), with its symbols 0‚Äì9 and its place [values](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/values) whereby the 7 in 703 counts as 7 hundreds, but in 173 it is 7 tens and in 507 it is 7 units. We consider powers of 10, such as 100 or 1,000, to be ‚Äúround numbers.‚Äù However, there is nothing special about 10, and any other number from 2 onward can be used as a [number base](https://www.britannica.com/science/base-number-systems). Indeed, computers use base 2, or the [binary number system](https://www.britannica.com/science/binary-number-system), written using only the symbols 0 and 1. Mathematicians distinguish ‚Äúgenuine‚Äù properties of numbers, which are true independent of any notational base, with ‚Äúaccidental‚Äù ones that arise only because of the notational system‚Äîfor example, that 153 (the number of fish in the Gospel According to John) is the sum of the cubes of its digits, 13 + 53 + 33 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153.

Occurrences of 10 and its powers are so common that there is no point in listing them here. However, the [Ten Commandments](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ten-Commandments) of the Bible deserve mention, especially given that Buddhism too has its own ten commandments‚Äîfive for monks and five for the laity.

### Number 11

Sandwiched between the two auspicious and important numbers 10 and 12, the number 11 generally has negative [connotations](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/connotations). Bungus stated that 11 has no connection with the divine, and medieval theology refers to the ‚Äú11 heads of error.‚Äù Because at any time one of the 12 zodiacal signs is hidden behind the Sun, the number 11 is often associated with the [zodiac](https://www.britannica.com/topic/zodiac). In the Babylonian [creation myth](https://www.britannica.com/topic/creation-myth) _Enuma Elish_ Tiamat, the god of [chaos](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chaos), is supported by 11 monsters. The ancient Roman equivalent of a police force [comprised](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/comprised) 11 men whose job was to hunt down criminals. Several sports involve teams with 11 members (American football, football \[soccer], cricket).

### Number 12

The number 12 is strongly associated with the heavens‚Äîthe 12 months, the 12 signs of the zodiac, and the 12 stations of the Moon and of the Sun. The ancients recognized 12 main northern stars and 12 main southern stars. There are 24 = 2 √ó 12 hours in the day, of which 12 are daytime and the other 12 nighttime. The number 12 is the product of the sacred and the [secular](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/secular) (3 √ó 4); it is the sum of the numbers of life and good fortune (5 + 7). It thus incorporates many distinct virtues. In Christianity it is the number of Christ‚Äôs [disciples](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/disciples), and it occurs many other times in the Bible‚Äîfor example, the [Twelve Tribes of Israel](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Twelve-Tribes-of-Israel). Several cultures have used numbers based on 12 (duodecimal); the 12 inches in a foot are one familiar relic of such a system.

### Number 13

Triskaidekaphobes believe 13 to be unlucky, especially when the 13th day of the month is a Friday, a fear that was reinforced by the explosion that almost wrecked the [Apollo 13](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Apollo-13-mission) lunar spacecraft in 1970. Skeptics note that it returned to Earth safely, unlike any other manned spacecraft that has exploded, making its crew some of the luckiest people on the planet. The fear of 13 may relate to [Judas Iscariot](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Judas-Iscariot)‚Äôs having been the 13th person to arrive at the [Last Supper](https://www.britannica.com/event/Last-Supper-Christianity), but its negative undertones go back much earlier, probably because an extra 13th item spoils the [auspicious](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/auspicious) 12. There are 13 lunar months in the year (with a small error), which led the Maya and the Hebrews to consider 13 as auspicious. In [medieval](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/medieval) theology 13 = 10 + 3 (Commandments plus Trinity), and therefore the number had some positive aspects.

### Number 14

The number 14 is an even number with attributes similar to those of 7. A period of 14 days is half of the Moon‚Äôs 28-day cycle, so it takes 14 days (one fortnight, short for fourteen-night) for the Moon to wax from new to full or to wane from full to new. In [ancient Egypt](https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Egypt) Osiris was cut into 14 parts. The number is important in Islam; the [Arabic alphabet](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Arabic-alphabet) contains 14 Sun letters and 14 Moon letters. In medieval Germany 14 innocent beings gave legal protection to whomever they accompanied.

### Number 15

As the product of two sacred numbers (3 √ó 5), 15 naturally has religious significance. In ancient [Nineveh](https://www.britannica.com/place/Nineveh-ancient-city-Iraq) the goddess [Ishtar](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ishtar-Mesopotamian-goddess) was served by 15 priests, and the city had 15 gates. The 3 √ó 3 [magic square](https://www.britannica.com/topic/magic-square) has 15 as its magic constant, and in Babylon this square was associated with Ishtar.

### Number 16

Because 16 is the square of 4, it [inherits](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/inherits) favourable attributes. It was popular in ancient India; the [Veda](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Veda)s talk of 16-fold incantations, and the Chinese-Indian goddess Pussa has 16 arms. The [Rosicrucian](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Rosicrucians)s believed that nature consisted of 16 elements.

### Number 17

In ancient times, in the region of [Urartu](https://www.britannica.com/place/Urartu), near [Mount Ararat](https://www.britannica.com/place/Mount-Ararat), the local deity was offered 17-fold sacrifices. The biblical Flood began on the 17th day of the second month and ended on the 17th day of the seventh month. Greek superstition holds the 17th day of the month to be the best day to cut wood to build a boat. Some followers of [Sufism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sufism) believe that the most sacred name of God has 17 letters. Mathematicians find 17 unusual because a regular 17-sided polygon can be constructed using the Euclidean tools of ruler and compass, a fact discovered by the German mathematician [Carl Friedrich Gauss](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carl-Friedrich-Gauss) at the age of 19.

### Number 18

Because 18 is twice 9, it has some significance by association with 9. In [Norse mythology](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Germanic-religion-and-mythology) Haldan has 18 sons and Odin knows 18 things. The number is sacred to the Sufi [mystics](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/mystics) who were known in the West as the whirling [dervishes](https://www.britannica.com/topic/dervish), and their custom was for a guest to bring gifts in multiples of 18. The Hindu [_Mahabharata_](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mahabharata) has 18 books, and the Jewish prayer _shemone  øesre_ (Hebrew: ‚Äúeighteen‚Äù) originally consisted of 18 blessings.

### Number 19

Eclipses of the Sun tend to recur in periods of 19 years. The Babylonians considered the 19th day of the month to be unlucky because it was 49 days from the beginning of the previous month (add 30), and, since 49 = 7 √ó 7, it was a day of great portent for good or evil. In Islamic numerology 19 is the value of the word _WƒÅ·∏•id_ (Arabic: ‚ÄúOne‚Äù), an important name for God.

### Number 20

The number 20 has little mystical significance, but it is historically interesting because the Mayan number system used [base](https://www.britannica.com/science/base-number-systems) 20. When counting time the Maya replaced 20 √ó 20 = 400 by 20 √ó 18 = 360 to approximate the number of days in the year. Many old units of measurement involve 20 (a score)‚Äîfor example, 20 [shillings](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/shillings) to the pound in predecimal British money.

### Number 100

Because our notational system for numbers is decimal (base 10), the number 100 takes on a significance that it would probably not possess if we employed other systems of notation. It is a round number and holds hints of perfection. The Western calendar is divided into the decade (10 years), century (100 years), and millennium (1,000 years), with the century as the most important unit. Thus, one refers to the 20th or 21st century as a way to establish a broad historical period. In the game of [cricket](https://www.britannica.com/sports/cricket-sport), scoring 100 runs (a century) is a major feat for a batsman, but to be out at 99 is a significant failure. A half-century (50) is also a sign of good play, whereas falling short at 49 is undesirable. (If we had seven fingers and counted in base 7, we would write 49 as 100, so presumably 49 would be considered an excellent score in such a culture.) The dollar is divided into 100 cents, and many other [currencies](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/currencies) (pound sterling, euro) involve a similar subdivision of the main unit of currency. The [Celsius temperature scale](https://www.britannica.com/technology/Celsius-temperature-scale) has 100 degrees as the [boiling point](https://www.britannica.com/science/boiling-point) of water. ‚ÄúA hundred‚Äù often just means ‚Äúa lot‚Äù; for example, the Roman centurion did not always command exactly 100 men.

By the same token, 101 often means ‚Äúa lot‚Äù too, but it is manifestly bigger than 100, and its lack of roundness makes it sound more precise, such as in the Disney-Company-produced _101 Dalmatians_ (1961).

## Numbers & Reality

### Nature's Numbers

Many aspects of the natural world display strong numerical patterns, and these may have been the source of some number mysticism. For example, crystals can have rotational symmetries that are [twofold](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/twofold), threefold, fourfold, and sixfold but not fivefold‚Äîa curious exception that was recognized empirically by the ancient Greeks and proved mathematically in the 19th century.

An especially significant number is the [golden ratio](https://www.britannica.com/science/golden-ratio), usually symbolized by the Greek letter œï. It goes back to early Greek mathematics under the name ‚Äúextreme and mean ratio‚Äù and refers to a division of a line segment in such a manner that the ratio of the whole to the larger part is the same as that of the larger part to the smaller. This ratio is precisely (1 + Square root of‚àö5)/2, or approximately 1.618034. The popular name _golden ratio_, or _golden number_, appears to have been introduced by the German mathematician Martin Ohm in _Die reine Elementarmathematik_ (1835; ‚ÄúPure Elementary Mathematics‚Äù). If not, the term is not much older and certainly does not go back to ancient Greece as is often claimed.

In art and [architecture](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/architecture) the [golden number](https://www.britannica.com/science/golden-number) is often said to be associated with elegance of proportion; some claim that it was used by the Greeks in the design of the [Parthenon](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Parthenon). There is little evidence for these claims. Any building has so many different lengths that some ratios are bound to be close to the golden number or for that matter to any other ratio that is not too large or small. The golden number is also often cited in connection with the shell of the [nautilus](https://www.britannica.com/animal/nautilus-cephalopod), but this too is a misunderstanding. The nautilus shell has a beautiful mathematical form, a so-called logarithmic (or equiangular) [spiral](https://www.britannica.com/science/spiral-mathematics). In such a spiral each successive turn is magnified in size by a fixed amount. There is a logarithmic spiral associated with the golden number, and in this case the fixed amount is precisely œï. However, the spiral of the nautilus does not have the ratio œï. Logarithmic spirals exist with any given number as their ratio, and the nautilus ratio has no special significance in mathematics.

The golden number is, however, legitimately associated with plants. This connection involves the [Fibonacci numbers](https://www.britannica.com/topic/number-game/Pythagorean-triples#ref27913) (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144,‚Ä¶), in which each number, starting with 2, is the sum of the previous two numbers. These numbers were first discussed in 1202 by the Italian mathematician [Leonardo Pisano](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Fibonacci), who seems to have been given the nickname Fibonacci (son of Bonaccio) in the 19th century. The ratio of successive Fibonacci numbers, such as 34/21 or 55/34, gets closer and closer to œï as the size of the numbers increases. As a result, Fibonacci numbers and œï enjoy an [intimate](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intimate) mathematical connection.

Fibonacci numbers are very common in the [plant](https://www.britannica.com/plant/plant) kingdom. Many flowers have 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, or 34 petals. Other numbers occur less commonly; typically they are twice a Fibonacci number, or they belong to the ‚Äúanomalous series‚Äù 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29,‚Ä¶, with the same rule of formation as the Fibonacci numbers but different initial values. Moreover, Fibonacci numbers occur in the seed heads of sunflowers and daisies. These are arranged as two families of interpenetrating spirals, and they typically contain, say, 55 clockwise spirals and 89 counterclockwise ones or some other pair of Fibonacci numbers.

This numerology is genuine, and it is related to the growth pattern of the plants. As the growing tip sprouts, new primordia‚Äîclumps of cells that will become special features such as seeds‚Äîarise along a generative spiral at successive multiples of a fixed angle. This angle is the one that produces the closest packing of primordia, and for sound mathematical reasons it is the golden angle: a fraction (1 ‚àí 1/œï) of a full circle, or roughly 137.5 degrees.

### Number‚Äôs nature

What exactly is a number? It is easy to see what two sheep or two apples are; you can find them in the real world. But what is 2? You never meet 2 in a field or a fruit bowl. The [symbol](https://www.britannica.com/topic/symbol) 2 is not a number but a symbol for a number. Until the 19th century, numbers were considered to be given by God‚Äîthey simply were. No one had to define the [concept](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/concept). Even in the 19th century the German mathematician [Leopold Kronecker](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Leopold-Kronecker) said, ‚ÄúGod made the integers, all else is the work of man.‚Äù

The 19th-century German logician [Gottlob Frege](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gottlob-Frege) attempted to define a number as ‚Äúthe class of all classes that can be put into one-to-one correspondence with a given class.‚Äù Basically, what he had in mind was that the abstract number 2 can be considered as the class of all pairs of objects: two sheep, two apples, two whatever. Lump all the pairs together, and the result is a single well-defined object that captures the essence of 2. Mathematicians would have been entirely happy with this definition, save for one problem. The English philosopher [Bertrand Russell](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bertrand-Russell) pointed out that the phrase ‚Äúclass of all classes that‚Ä¶‚Äù may not always have a sensible meaning. He stated his famous [paradox](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/paradox) about ‚Äúthe class of all classes that do not contain themselves.‚Äù Equivalently, it is the paradox of the barber who shaves everyone who does not shave himself. So who shaves the barber? Or imagine a catalog of all catalogs that do not list themselves. Does this supercatalog list itself or not?

Today, numbers are viewed as logical constructs, and their existence holds good only in a rather abstract mathematical sense in which something exists if it is not logically self-contradictory. Numbers are defined in terms of conceptually simpler objects, sets, through a kind of counting procedure. The [Russell paradox](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Russells-paradox) is no longer a problem, but it has been replaced by the far deeper paradox of the Austrian-born American logician [Kurt G√∂del](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kurt-Godel). G√∂del‚Äôs theorem states that if arithmetic is not self-contradictory‚Äîthat is, if numbers exist in the mathematical sense‚Äîthen that fact can never be proved mathematically. So perhaps numbers really are as mystical as many people believe.
