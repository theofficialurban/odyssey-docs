## Overview

The provided documents outline comprehensive strategies for **Psychological Operations (PSYOP)**, detailing their application in both conventional and unconventional warfare scenarios. One source explains how **guerrilla movements** utilize psychological tactics, such as **armed propaganda teams** and **covert recruitment of "Social Crusaders,"** to gain popular support and destabilize existing governments by exploiting societal weaknesses and controlling public discourse through **meetings and mass assemblies**. The other source, a **U.S. Army Field Manual**, defines **PSYOP** as missions to influence foreign populations' behavior in support of **U.S. national objectives**, covering organizational structures, planning processes, and various **dissemination methods**, while also addressing legal and ethical constraints like **rules of engagement** and the prohibition against targeting U.S. citizens. Both emphasize the critical role of **propaganda** and **persuasion techniques**, whether through **face-to-face interactions** by **propagandist-combatants** or through sophisticated **media production and broadcast capabilities**. The texts collectively underscore the importance of understanding **target audiences** and adapting **psychological activities** to specific cultural, political, and operational environments to achieve desired strategic and tactical outcomes.

## The Seven-Phase PSYOP Process: Unveiling the Mechanisms of Behavioral Control

Psychological Operations (PSYOP) are a calculated, systematic exertion of influence, a nonlethal fires capability meticulously designed to mold the behavior of foreign target audiences (TAs) to align with U.S. national objectives. This isn't a mere suggestion; it's a profound, observable modification of behavior, achieved through a rigorously defined, seven-phase process. This process is the very architecture of manipulation, a continuous cycle of planning, analysis, development, approval, execution, and relentless evaluation, ensuring that every whisper and every action serves the overarching goal of control.

The PSYOP mission is singular: to influence behavior. This endeavor is so foundational that behavioral change is explicitly stated as the root of PSYOP mission success. PSYOP are not accidental; they are planned operations, a core capability of information operations (IO). They are inherently joint, frequently combined, and critical across the entire spectrum of conflict, from peace to war, and into post-conflict stabilization. Tactical PSYOP forces, acting as the supported commander's most potent communication conduit, interact directly with foreign TAs at the very juncture where behavior can be most effectively shifted and assessed.

### Phase I: Planning (The Genesis of Manipulation)

The PSYOP process is initiated with Planning, a complex and integrated phase requiring profound involvement in the supported unit’s military decision-making process (MDMP). During this phase, the bedrock of the entire influence campaign is laid. PSYOP planners are tasked with developing Psychological Operations Objectives (POs), Supporting Psychological Operations Objectives (SPOs), identifying Potential Target Audiences (PTAs), and determining Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs). This culminates in the drafting of the PSYOP Appendix to the IO Annex, the foundational document for subsequent actions.

POs are not vague aspirations; they are measurable statements of desired behavioral change from specific foreign TAs. They form the overarching framework for the entire PSYOP plan, guided by broad themes originating at the policy-maker level. SPOs, in turn, articulate the specific behavioral or attitudinal responses sought from the TA to achieve the POs. These SPOs are distinct for each PO, with typically two or more per objective, ensuring a granular focus on desired shifts. The initial PTAs are broad strokes, later refined, representing groups whose behavior is to be influenced.

A critical component of this phase is the determination of MOEs, which are framed as questions directly tied to PTAs. These MOEs are submitted as Information Requirements (IRs) for inclusion in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) plans, allowing PSYOP to leverage broader intelligence assets. The answers to these MOEs become "impact indicators," forming the baseline data against which PSYOP effectiveness will be ruthlessly measured.

The approval of these POs and broad themes is not a low-level affair; it is reserved for the highest echelons—the President, Secretary of Defense (SecDef), combatant commands, Joint Force Commanders (JFC), and U.S. Country Teams—to allow for interagency evaluation against national-level information programs. This centralized planning, coupled with decentralized execution, demands extreme clarity in objectives and themes.

### Phase II: Target Audience Analysis (Dissecting the Prey)

Target Audience Analysis (TAA) is the second phase, a "detailed, systematic examination of PSYOP-relevant information to select TAs that can accomplish a given SPO". This is where the chosen PTAs are subjected to intense scrutiny, becoming "homogenous groups that share similar conditions and vulnerabilities". The Target Audience Analysis Process (TAAP) is a precise, 10-step methodology focused on influencing a single TA under a single SPO.

The TAAP seeks to answer four fundamental questions:

1. Which TAs will be most effective in achieving the desired behavioral or attitudinal response?
2. What Lines of Persuasion (LOPs) will sway the TA?
3. What media will effectively deliver the chosen LOP?
4. What events will signal success or failure?

The primary tool in this dissection is the Target Audience Analysis Work Sheet (TAAW), which aids in identifying LOPs, symbols, and media. This document is dynamic, constantly reviewed and updated due to the fluid nature of TA conditions and vulnerabilities. PSYOP analysts meticulously research conditions such as foreign relations, demographics, economic, social, political, and environmental issues, documenting sources and classifications. They identify vulnerabilities (needs, wants, desires) that can be exploited, minimized, or even created. LOPs are then crafted as persuasive arguments, addressing vulnerabilities, incorporating appeals (e.g., self-interest), and techniques (e.g., glittering generalities, explanations). Each LOP is then evaluated for its "susceptibility"—the degree to which the TA can be influenced, rated on a scale of 1 to 10.

Media analysis determines "accessibility"—the availability of an audience for targeting. This involves an eight-step process, including technical aspects of broadcast agencies like location, frequency, and power of transmitters. Impact indicators, which are answers to MOEs, are identified, refining those established in Phase I. Propaganda analysis, often using the SCAME (Source, Content, Audience, Media, Effects) technique, is embedded in this phase to understand adversary influence. The Target Audience Analysis Team (TAAT) is the primary organizational element executing this phase, constantly monitoring intelligence to detect shifts in attitudes or behaviors.

### Phase III: Series Development (Crafting the Behavioral Chains)

Series Development is a "complex, creative, and collaborative process" that generates multiple products and actions to change the behavior of a single TA and achieve a single SPO. A single product rarely alters behavior; effective influence comes from a consistent, coordinated "series" of products and actions across a mix of media. The scale of the series is dictated by the complexity of shifting the TA from its current to its desired behavior.

The TAAW, a product of Phase II, serves as the source document. Key steps involve determining the desired effect on the TA for each stage of the series, the LOP to use, the media type, and the staging of the series. This means sequencing arguments, considering needs conflicts, and tailoring arguments for specific media. The staging is crucial, as supporting arguments may build on one another, preventing dissemination of later stages if earlier ones are rejected by the TA.

This phase produces three critical documents:

1. **Series Concept Work Sheet (SCW):** Outlines the series number, PO, SPO, TA, LOPs, symbols, media types, and product ideas.
2. **Series Dissemination Work Sheet (SDW):** Sequences and synchronizes the dissemination of all products and actions within the series. It details overall series duration, start/end dates, timing, frequency, location, placement, and quantity for each product. This is designed to avoid oversaturating the TA while ensuring sufficient coverage.
3. **Series Execution Matrix (SEM):** Provides a visual representation for tracking and managing the series.

### Phase IV: Product Development and Design (Forging the Tools of Persuasion)

This phase transforms the product requirements identified in series development (Phase III) into tangible "product prototypes or planned actions". It's the tangible manifestation of the planned influence. The core output for each individual product or action in the series is a Product/Action Work Sheet (PAW). Alongside the PAW, untranslated pretest and posttest questionnaires, and product prototypes (or substitutes if actual production is too costly or inappropriate) are generated.

The PAW acts as the source document and conceptual guide for producing these prototypes and testing instruments. It contains essential information such as the product/action number, PO, SPO, series number, TA, specific LOPs, symbols, media type, and suspense dates. The Product Development Detachment (PDD) or Psychological Operations Development Team (PDT) leverages its illustration and graphics capabilities, using tools like the Product Development Workstation (PDW), to produce visual, audio, and audiovisual products.

Crucially, this phase also establishes the methodology for pretesting and posttesting PSYOP products. This involves developing questionnaires, surveys, and criteria for both survey sampling (probability and nonprobability) and focus groups (panels of TA members, representatives, or experts). Pretesting aims to assess potential effectiveness and refine products before wide dissemination. Face-to-Face Encounter Orders (FFEOs) are also prepared, providing a "plan of attack" for direct communication with TAs.

### Phase V: Approval (Sanctioning the Influence)

The Approval phase is the critical juncture where authorization is secured to disseminate products and execute actions, thereby initiating the behavioral change campaign. This is not a piecemeal approval; it occurs as a complete "series package". The central document enabling this is a "Change to the PSYOP Appendix," which, once issued as part of a supported unit’s Fragmentary Order (FRAGO), becomes an explicit order for all supported elements to execute the series.

The Change to the PSYOP Appendix adheres to a standard five-paragraph format and includes seven crucial attachments: the Series Executive Summary (SES), SEM, PAW Index, TAAW, SCW, SDW, and the Psychological Operations Transmission Matrix (PTM). The SES provides a concise overview for the supported commander, detailing the PO, TA, desired behavior (SPO), media, units involved, timeline, and geographic locations.

While high-level authorities (President, SecDef, combatant command, JFC, U.S. Country Teams) approve PSYOP objectives and broad themes, the approval authority for series and products can be delegated, potentially as low as a maneuver commander with SecDef approval. However, the PSYOP Task Force (POTF) commander typically retains coordinating authority over tactical PSYOP units for development, design, production, and dissemination. A streamlined staffing process, involving key staff elements such as the Chief of Staff, G-3, G-7 IO, Political Advisor (POLAD), and Staff Judge Advocate (SJA), is vital to prevent protracted delays that could compromise responsiveness. Failing to respond within a specified timeframe implies consent, a mechanism designed to accelerate the process. All PSYOP series must be staffed through the POTF or PSYOP Support Element (PSE) for comments and product number approval, ensuring centralized control and unity of effort across all PSYOP elements.

### Phase VI: Production, Distribution, and Dissemination (Unleashing the Deluge)

Once approval is granted, Phase VI commences the physical manifestation and delivery of the influence campaign. This phase includes translation of products, pretesting (to catch any last-minute issues), actual production, distribution, dissemination, and posttesting. The SEM, SDW, and the Change to the PSYOP Appendix serve as the timelines for this phase.

Production involves transforming approved prototypes into various media formats compatible with how foreign populations consume information. PSYOP forces possess organic visual, audio, and audiovisual production assets, though units below the POTF level (e.g., Tactical Psychological Operations Development Detachment - TPDD) may have limited capabilities. Nonorganic assets, including other Services, local facilities, other government agencies (OGAs), and contracted companies, are also leveraged for cost-effectiveness and timely production.

Distribution is the movement of these completed products from the production source to the point of dissemination. This can involve temporary physical or electronic storage and is often complicated by classification requirements. PSYOP-specific digital systems like File Transfer Protocol (FTP), SIPRNET, the Psychological Operations Automated System (POAS), and the Product Distribution System (PDS) are utilized. Local National (LN) assets and supported unit logistics networks are also integrated to ensure broad reach.

Dissemination is the direct delivery of the PSYOP products to the chosen TA. Media analysis conducted during TAA guides the selection of the most effective dissemination methods, which are then specified on the SDW. Critical factors influencing this choice include the existing communication infrastructure, media availability and credibility, language and dialects, social taboos, media control, technical capabilities (e.g., transmitter power), and physical conditions like terrain and weather. Common methods include loudspeaker operations, printed product dissemination (handbills, leaflets, posters, newspapers), and face-to-face communication. Tactical PSYOP Teams (TPTs) are instrumental in executing these tasks, especially loudspeaker operations, face-to-face communication, and localized dissemination. Posttesting activities are initiated during this phase, with observations and data collected for later evaluation.

### Phase VII: Evaluation (Measuring the Enslavement)

The final phase, Evaluation, is perhaps the most critical, yet "most resource intensive of all PSYOP tasks". It consists of two interwoven activities: rigorous testing (pretesting and posttesting of individual products) and the ongoing assessment of overall PSYOP effectiveness over time. The ultimate goal is to ascertain the extent to which SPOs, and subsequently POs, are achieved.

Testing, discussed in Phase IV and conducted in Phase VI, focuses on validating that LOPs, symbols, and product designs are achieving their intended goals. The results of this testing, including surveys and interviews, are reported to higher PSYOP echelons for analysis and appropriate action. Impact indicators, which are the answers to the MOEs established in Phase I and refined in Phase II, are collated and analyzed during this phase. These indicators, along with spontaneous events related to the PSYOP effort, provide concrete evidence of the TA's behavioral response and serve as the "scale for evaluating PSYOP". Establishing a baseline with initial impact indicators allows for subsequent measurements to determine the degree of behavioral change over time.

Evaluation is labor-intensive and continuous, ensuring that resources are correctly allocated and timely modifications can be incorporated to maintain PSYOP effectiveness. It allows PSYOP to provide assessments to supported commanders on whether SPOs are being met, and crucially, _why_ they are succeeding or failing. The Target Audience Analysis Team (TAAT) is responsible for managing Phase VII, conducting analysis of impact indicators, surveys, and interviews. Tactical PSYOP Teams (TPTs), being in direct contact with TAs, play a vital role in gathering PSYOP-relevant information, conducting pretesting and posttesting, observing impact indicators, and conducting interviews. This ground-level feedback is critical for higher echelons to make accurate assessments and adjustments to PSYOP series.

### Broader Context: PSYOP as a Tool of Comprehensive Influence

The seven-phase process operates within a larger, intricate web of PSYOP capabilities and organizational structures, all geared toward pervasive influence.

**Core Tasks and Roles:** Beyond the specific phases, PSYOP Soldiers perform six core tasks: develop, distribute, disseminate, and evaluate. Their roles include advising commanders, influencing foreign populations, providing public information, serving as the supported commander's voice, and countering enemy propaganda.

**Integration with Information Operations (IO):** PSYOP is a core capability within the broader domain of IO, functioning as both a user and contributor to IO activities. It is mutually supportive, with each enhancing the other's effectiveness. PSYOP personnel are embedded within IO cells at various command levels (J-3, G-3/G-7, S-3) to integrate, coordinate, and deconflict PSYOP plans with other IO elements like electronic warfare, military deception, operations security (OPSEC), and computer network operations. This ensures consistency of message and optimizes credibility, amplifying the synergistic effect of influence.

**Intelligence Support:** Effective PSYOP is impossible without extensive intelligence support, implying a constant, mutual exchange of information between PSYOP units and traditional intelligence elements. PSYOP forces are deeply integrated into the Army's Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield (IPB) process, focusing on defining the battlespace, describing its effects, evaluating threats, and determining threat Courses of Action (COAs) from a PSYOP perspective. This includes specialized propaganda analysis, often utilizing the SCAME technique, and the development of counterpropaganda strategies. The Strategic Studies Detachment (SSD) provides comprehensive analysis of the PSYOP environment, producing detailed studies and assessments. TPTs are crucial "passive collectors," gathering PSYOP-relevant information directly from TAs, feeding it back into the intelligence and development process.

**Command Authority and Coordination:** While planning can be centralized, execution is often decentralized. Command authority for PSYOP forces ultimately rests with the supported commander. However, a critical PSYOP coordination chain exists, from the PSYOP Task Force (POTF) down to the smallest tactical element, ensuring synchronization and preventing contradictory messages. The POTF often serves as a functional component command, bringing together regional, tactical, and dissemination capabilities under robust command and control (C2).

**Organizational Structures:** The entire process is executed by a hierarchy of specialized units. This includes the Tactical Psychological Operations Battalion (POB), its constituent Tactical Psychological Operations Companies (TPCs), Tactical Psychological Operations Detachments (TPDs), and the fundamental three-person Tactical Psychological Operations Teams (TPTs). At higher echelons, the PSYOP Development Center (PDC) and Tactical Psychological Operations Development Detachment (TPDD), with their Plans and Programs Teams (PPTs), Target Audience Analysis Teams (TAATs), and Product Development Teams (PDTs), are central to development and design. The PSYOP Support Element (PSE) provides tailored PSYOP support for smaller-scale missions, often relying on "reachback" capabilities to larger PSYOP organizations for resources and expertise.

This seven-phase process, intertwined with intelligence, IO, and a specialized command structure, represents a comprehensive framework for shaping perceptions and influencing actions. The depth and systematic nature of this process underscore its power as a tool for achieving strategic ends through controlled behavioral modification.
