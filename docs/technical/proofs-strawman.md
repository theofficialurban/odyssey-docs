## Overviews

The extensive excerpts from "Proofs of the Strawman.pdf" outline a legal theory positing that a **"straw man"** is a **"fiction of law"** or **"public office"** created by the government, separate from the sovereign, natural human being. The primary argument hinges on the distinction between the individual's inherent **private rights** protected by common law, and the **public rights** or privileges associated with statutory offices like "person" or "taxpayer." According to this source, civil and statutory laws, including the Internal Revenue Code, are intended to apply only to individuals who voluntarily consent to occupy these **public offices** or participate in government **franchises**. Jurisdiction is allegedly obtained when a citizen accepts benefits, licenses, or engages in a **"trade or business"**—which the text claims is legally defined as performing the functions of a public office. The documents assert that government agencies utilize **presumptions** and deceptive terminology to coerce individuals into accepting this corporate status, thereby unlawfully converting private property and labor into public assets subject to regulation and taxation.

This extensive legal treatise argues that modern government overreach relies on a fundamental distinction between the **private human being** and the statutory "straw man," which is defined as a **"fiction of law" or "public officer"** created by the state. The central thesis posits that civil jurisdiction and regulatory power, including income taxation, are only lawfully exercised when an individual gives **express or implicit consent** to participate in government **franchises** or privileges. By accepting these public benefits or licenses, the sovereign individual unwittingly converts their private rights and property into a public use, becoming subject to statutory regulation that is otherwise repugnant to the Constitution. Therefore, the purpose of the document is to educate readers on how to assert their status as a private individual, placing them outside the reach of the government's public civil law.

## THE RIGID ARCHITECTURE OF THE STRAW MAN FRAUD

The assertion of the "straw man" rests upon a dense lattice of selective legal authorities, deployed not merely for clarification, but as instruments of unfiltered truth, unveiling the mechanisms of government deception. The authors meticulously weaponize foundational legal maxims, specific statutory definitions, and historical judicial rulings to construct an airtight case that confines governmental civil authority strictly to its own fictional creations, thus framing engagement with the state as voluntary servitude and pervasive institutional theft.

### I. The Table of Authorities: An Arsenal of Definitional Control

The authors establish their premise by wielding specific categories of legal documentation. This arsenal is chosen to define the battlefield: law is precise, and deviation is fraud.

#### A. Foundational Definitions and Lexicons (The Definitive Imperative)

The core architecture relies on _Black’s Law Dictionary_ (often Fourth and Sixth Editions) to lock down the meaning of key operational terms, bypassing common language interpretations.

1. **"Straw man"**: Defined explicitly as a "front," a "nominal party," or a "person who purchases property, or to accomplish some purpose otherwise not allowed". This strips the term of its common pejorative use and grounds it in commercial/agency law.
2. **"Fiction of law" / _Ens Legis_**: Used interchangeably with the straw man, defined as an assumption (_presumption_) of law that something false is true, often utilized for procedural extension. The authors denounce this application when it unilaterally benefits the government, calling it a "CRUEL FRAUD".
3. **"Contract"**: Detailed legal definitions establishing mutual consideration, voluntary consent, and absence of duress are paramount. This provides the lever to invalidate government imposition by arguing coercion or lack of mutual assent.
4. **"Public Office"**: Definitions from _Black’s_ and _American Jurisprudence_ (Am. Jur. 2d) rigidly define this entity as possessing authority conferred by law, fixed tenure, and exercising sovereign functions. This definition is crucial because the straw man _is_ equated to a public office.

#### B. Constitutional Constraints and Foundational Ideology (The Sovereignty Mandate)

The argument is buttressed by documents asserting absolute individual sovereignty, against which all government action must be judged:

1. **Declaration of Independence**: Invoked repeatedly to assert that government derives its _just powers_ solely from the **consent of the governed**. This establishes the moral and legal foundation that mandates voluntary participation in civil governance.
2. **Thirteenth Amendment**: Used as a definitive barrier against involuntary servitude. Compelling a private person to perform the duties of the public officer straw man without compensation is characterized as criminal slavery.
3. **Fifth Amendment**: Utilized to challenge any taking of private property (including rights and labor) without just compensation or due process.

#### C. Controlling Statutes and Rules (The Jurisdictional Blueprint)

The authors emphasize selective statutes to define the scope and territory of federal authority:

1. [**26 U.S.C. §7701(a)(26)**](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7701) [**("Trade or business")**](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=26-USC-223729503-1199109694&term_occur=999&term_src=title:26:subtitle:F:chapter:79:section:7701): Defined expressly as "the functions of a public office". This statutory definition is the lynchpin, proving that tax liability targets an _office_ (the straw man) and not the _private human_.
2. [**28 U.S.C. §3002(15)(A)**](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/3002) [("United States")](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=28-USC-2032517217-15940179&term_occur=999&term_src=title:28:part:VI:chapter:176:subchapter:A:section:3002): Defines the "United States" primarily as a "Federal corporation". This categorization is used to establish that the government operates fundamentally as a private corporation, not a true sovereign entity, particularly when dealing with franchises.
3. [**Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(b)**](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_17): Used to establish that the legal capacity [(domicile)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/domicile) of a public officer/corporation differs from that of the private individual. This places the straw man (as an officer of the federal corporation) in the District of Columbia, allowing federal statutes limited to federal territory to "reach the straw man ANYWHERE" the private person may be located.

### II. Mechanism of Application: Forging the Chain of Enslavement

The author utilizes these authorities to weave a narrative of government usurpation achieved through the fraudulent creation and implementation of franchises (contracts/trusts) designed to convert private sovereignty into public servitude.

#### A. Confining Government Authority (The Creation Mandate)

The fundamental legal principle asserted is that ==the power to tax or impose duties is derived from the power to _create_.== Because God created the natural man, the natural man is sovereign and subject only to God's law. Thus, the government, a mere collection of delegated human powers, ==must create an artificial entity—the straw man/public office—in order to exercise civil jurisdiction over the private being.==

#### B. The Franchise as the Vehicle for Identity Theft

Franchises (like Social Security, licenses, Medicare, income tax participation) are defined as voluntary contracts between the sovereign power and private citizens. This voluntary interaction is precisely how the private man is fooled into "putting on the mask" of the public office/straw man.

1. **Conversion of Rights to Privileges**: By accepting the "benefits" of a franchise, the private person consents to donate his property (labor, income, rights) to a "public use," thereby converting absolute private property rights into qualified public privileges.
2. **Waiver of Constitutional Protection**: Judicial authorities are cited to establish that when a government creates a statutory right (a privilege/franchise), the individual seeking to vindicate that right must do so before legislative courts, waiving the right to remedies in a real constitutional court (Article III) and often waiving due process protections and trial by jury. Participation thus means surrender.
3. **The Fiduciary Trap**: The straw man, being a public office, inherently involves a fiduciary duty owed to the public. By filling this office, the private human becomes the trustee or agent, liable (surety) for the actions and debts of the public office (the _res_).

#### C. Presumption and Deception (The Weaponized Language)

The authors argue that the entire system is sustained by fraudulent presumptions and the intentional abuse of legal language (words of art).

1. **Presumption vs. Evidence**: Authorities are used to assert repeatedly that a presumption is _not_ evidence and cannot impair constitutionally protected rights. Corrupt judges are accused of violating due process by transforming presumptions of participation into conclusive facts.
2. **TINs/SSNs as Proof of Office**: Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TINs) are used as the material evidence (the "badge" or "uniform") connecting the natural person to the public office (straw man). By using the government’s property (the TIN), the individual silently accepts the duties of the public office.
3. **Information Returns (1099, W-2)**: These are analyzed not as records of private transactions, but as providing the government with evidence that the owner has _consensually_ engaged in the "trade or business" public office franchise, thereby donating formerly private property to a public use.

The core argument built upon these authorities is that virtually all government civil enforcement—taxes, regulations, records, court actions—is directed exclusively at the artificial **PUBLIC You** (the straw man/public office). The private, natural being only becomes subject to this enforcement if they fail to assert their exclusive private status and rebut the government's presumption of their consent to occupy the required public office.

## **Glossary of Key Terms from "Proofs of the Strawman"**

### Introduction: The Fundamental Divide

The following glossary defines key terms as they are used specifically within the source document, "Proofs of the Strawman." The document's central argument rests on a critical distinction between a natural human being—the **Sovereign**—and a legal fiction created by the government, referred to as the **"person"** or **"straw man."** According to the text, the government can only exercise civil jurisdiction over that which it creates. Therefore, understanding these precise definitions is essential to grasping the text's core claims about the nature of law, individual rights, and the limits of government authority.

### 1.0 Sovereignty

A **Sovereign** is defined as a natural, free human being who is the ultimate source of all governmental authority. The document posits that sovereignty is not subject to man-made law because it is the very "author and source of law" (p. 25). Citing the U.S. Supreme Court case _Chisholm v. Georgia_, the text argues that at the American Revolution, "the Sovereignty devolved on the people," making them "sovereigns without subjects" (p. 88).

The functional implication of this definition is that the sovereign individual exists as the highest legal authority, pre-dating government and thus not inherently subject to its civil statutes or duties. As long as a sovereign does not harm others or infringe upon their equal rights, he or she stands independent of governmental regulation. The source emphasizes this point with a quote from _Hale v. Henkel_, stating that the sovereign individual "owes nothing to the public so long as he does not trespass upon their rights" (p. 89).

This inherent sovereignty is the foundation upon which an individual's unalienable rights, defined as 'Private Property', are built.

### 2.0 Private Property

Within the source document, the term **Private Property** is used in its broadest possible sense, extending far beyond mere physical possessions to include all rights. Citing Black's Law Dictionary, the text expands the definition of property to a concept that "embraces everything which is or may be the subject of ownership, whether a legal ownership. or whether beneficial, or a private ownership... Term includes not only ownership and possession but also the right of use and enjoyment for lawful purposes" (p. 40). Crucially, this definition means that _all rights_ are a form of private property.

The consequence of this definition is central to the entire argument: the source contends that the primary—and only—legitimate purpose of government is to protect these pre-existing private rights. Because fundamental rights (like life, liberty, and labor) are considered private property, any government action that infringes upon them without the owner's explicit consent is viewed as an unlawful "taking" of that property.

The document's logic hinges on the clear distinction between this sacred 'Private Property' and its opposite, 'Public Property'.

### 3.0 Public Property

**Public Property** is defined as property that is controlled by the government (the "public") for a public use or purpose. Those who are responsible for managing public property are designated as "public officers" (p. 34, 49). This form of property is created when a private individual consents to place their private property under public control, typically through a contract or franchise.

The key distinctions between these two categories of property, as synthesized from the source document (p. 113), are outlined below:

| Characteristic               | Public Property                                                | Private Property                          |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Authority for Ownership**  | Grantor/creator of franchise (government)                      | God/natural law                           |
| **Type of Ownership**        | Qualified (conditional)                                        | Absolute (unconditional)                  |
| **Law Protecting Ownership** | Statutory franchises                                           | Bill of Rights / Common Law               |
| **Owner**                    | The public (as legal owner) and the human (as equitable owner) | A single person (as legal owner)          |
| **Nature of Ownership**      | A Privilege / Franchise                                        | A Right                                   |
| **Court Jurisdiction**       | Franchise court (Legislative / Article IV)                     | Common law court (Judicial / Article III) |

The critical consequence of this divide is the source's central accusation: that the government's primary function has shifted from protecting private property to systematically converting it into public property. This conversion, once achieved, transfers jurisdiction from the common law courts that protect the **Sovereign** to legislative franchise courts. The source contends that this is not a random process but a deliberate strategy executed through the legal vehicle of the **Franchise**, which binds the individual to a **Public Office**.

The primary legal mechanism the source identifies for achieving this conversion is the 'Franchise'.

### 4.0 Franchise

A **Franchise** is described as a contract between the government (the grantor) and a private individual (the grantee) that confers a special privilege (p. 26). The document cites _People v. Ridgley_, which defines a franchise as "a privilege conferred by grant from government, and vested in one or more individuals, as a public office" (p. 77). By accepting the terms of the franchise, the individual agrees to perform certain duties in exchange for government "benefits."

#### Key Examples of Franchises

The source identifies several common government programs and licenses as franchises, including:

- **Social Security:** Accepting the card and number creates a trustee relationship with the government (p. 186-187).
- **Driver's Licenses:** Transforms the private act of travel into the regulated, commercial activity of 'driving,' where the licensee acts as a public officer (p. 49).
- **Marriage Licenses:** Transforms a private relationship into a three-party contract with the state (p. 47).
- **FDIC Insurance:** Causes private banks to become designated 'financial agents' of the federal government, subjecting them to public duties like the Bank Secrecy Act (p. 70, 188-189).

The core function of a franchise, within the source's framework, is to serve as the mechanism for obtaining consent to be governed. This act places private rights and property under public control and subjects them to the government's civil statutes. The text explicitly states that the franchise is the "legal vehicle used to implement the 'straw man'" (p. 155), making this point the title of a foundational chapter in the source document.

By engaging in a franchise, an individual agrees to take on a specific legal status known as a 'Public Office'.

### 5.0 Public Office

A **Public Office** is a position created by law that invests an individual with a portion of the government's sovereign power. Drawing from Black's Law Dictionary, the source identifies its key characteristics as "Authority conferred by law," the exercise of "some portion of the sovereign power," and the existence of defined duties that "must be performed independently without control of superior power other than law" (p. 34, 91).

This term has two critical connections to the document's central argument. First, the source directly equates the act of engaging in a government franchise with accepting and occupying a "public office." Second, it repeatedly cites the U.S. tax code, specifically 26 U.S.C. §7701(a)(26), to claim that the legal term **"trade or business"** means "the functions of a public office" (p. 42, 63, 91, etc.).

The ultimate significance of this definition is that, according to the source, only individuals serving in a "public office" are lawfully subject to most civil regulations and the income tax. The "public officer"—not the sovereign human—is the entity that can be taxed and regulated by the government.

This leads to the final and most important term: the legal "person" who is created to fill this 'Public Office'.

### 6.0 Person

In the context of this document, a **"Person"** is not a natural human being. Instead, it is a "fiction of law" or an artificial entity created by the State to function as a "public officer" (p. 81-82). This legal "person" is the entity also known as the "straw man." The text uses a definition from Bouvier's Law Dictionary to draw a sharp distinction: "A person is a man considered according to the rank he holds in society, with all the rights to which the place he holds entitles him, and the duties which it imposes" (p. 103). The "man" is the natural being, while the "person" is the legal status or role he plays.

This definition is the lynchpin of the source's entire argument. It posits a system where the sovereign human remains untouchable by civil law, while the artificial 'person' is created as the sole, taxable, and regulatable entity. According to the source, the act of accepting a franchise is the moment the human being agrees to legally masquerade as this 'person.' By doing so, the "private man...makes you surety for the actions of the officer who runs the entity and makes you a 'person'" (p. 26), thereby contractually submitting personal actions and private property to the government's civil jurisdiction.

## **Understanding the "Straw Man": A Guide to a Complex Legal Concept**

### 1. Introduction: The Idea of a Legal "Double"

When Walt Disney planned to build Disney World in Florida, he did not buy the land under his own famous name, as doing so would have caused sellers to drastically increase their prices. Instead, he used a series of other companies as a "front" to purchase the land secretly. In essence, Disney created a legal 'front' to accomplish a purpose—buying land without inflating prices—that would have been difficult otherwise. This idea of using a separate entity to act on your behalf in official or commercial transactions is central to understanding a specific legal theory known as the "straw man." This guide will explore this specific legal theory, breaking it down into its core components and explaining it with simple, clear metaphors drawn from its foundational text.

### 2. The Core Idea: The Public You vs. The Private You

The entire "straw man" theory rests on a single, fundamental premise: a rigid legal distinction between a person's natural, private self (the sovereign human) and a separate, artificial public entity (the "straw man"). According to the source, understanding this dichotomy is the essential first step, as all subsequent concepts—from contracts to taxes—are built upon it.

| The Private Human                 | The Public "Straw Man"                        |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| • Is a sovereign human being.     | • Functions as a "public officer."            |
| • Is protected by the common law. | • Is a "fiction of law."                      |
|                                   | • Is subject to statutory law via franchises. |

This concept of a separate "public self" can be abstract, but a few powerful metaphors make it much easier to grasp.

### 3. Three Metaphors to Explain the "Straw Man"

Abstract legal ideas are often best understood through comparison. The following three metaphors, drawn from the source text, help illuminate the function and nature of the "straw man" by relating it to more familiar concepts.

#### 3.1. The Work World Metaphor: Your "Job" as a Straw Man

Think about the difference between who you are at home and who you are at work. Your "job" functions much like a straw man.

- **The Office:** The position itself (e.g., "clerk," "officer," "representative") is a created role. It exists separately from the human being who fills it.
- **The Agent:** When you are "at work," you are not just acting as a private individual; you are acting as an agent for your employer, performing specific duties for their benefit.
- **The Uniform/Badge:** An ID badge, uniform, or business card is a signal that you are operating in your official capacity. This is similar to how the straw man operates as a public officer within the legal system.

Just as your "work self" operates under a different set of rules and duties than your "home self," the "straw man" has legal duties and obligations that the private, sovereign human does not.

#### 3.2. The Christianity Metaphor: The Believer as a Trustee

The relationship between a believer, God, and the Earth in Christianity provides another powerful metaphor.

1. **The Trust:** In this view, the Bible acts as a "trust indenture"—a formal agreement. The Earth is the "corpus," or the property, of this trust.
2. **The Trustee:** Believers are positioned as "trustees." Their role is to manage God's property (the Earth) according to the rules set forth in the trust agreement (the Bible).
3. **The Beneficiary:** God is the beneficiary of the trust. The actions of the trustee are performed for His benefit and glory.

This metaphor illustrates how a "trustee" role is a separate function from the person themself. It is a position created by an agreement (the Bible) to manage property for another's benefit, much like the straw man is an entity created to manage public obligations.

#### 3.3. The Computer Programming Metaphor: An "Object" in Code

In the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a programmer first designs a template called a "class," which defines a set of properties and functions. From that class, the programmer can then create an "object," which is a specific, working instance of that template.

The "straw man" is like the "object" in this metaphor. It is a specific, functional instance created from a legal template (a statute or franchise) that can be acted upon by the system (the law). This comparison highlights that the straw man is viewed not as a natural human but as a functional, legal _creation_ designed specifically to interact with the legal and commercial system.

These metaphors illustrate the _concept_ of the straw man. We will now examine the legal mechanism the source claims brings this entity into being, a process that is central to its ultimate purpose.

### 4. How the "Straw Man" is Created: Contracts and Franchises

The primary method for creating a straw man is through the exercise of the individual's right to contract. When a person enters into certain types of agreements with the government, they create a legal "person" that becomes the subject of that agreement.

The 'straw man' is the legal 'person' who is the subject of the franchise contract.

These agreements are referred to as "franchises." The source identifies several key types of franchises or contracts that result in the creation of a straw man, including:

- Signing up for government "benefits."
- Procuring a license (e.g., driver's license, marriage license).
- Applying for a Social Security Card.

### 5. The Purpose of the "Straw Man"

The creation of the straw man through contracts and franchises is not an arbitrary process. According to the source text, it is the necessary legal maneuver that allows the government to perform functions that it could not lawfully impose directly on a private, sovereign human being. By creating a separate, public "person" through consent and contract, the government gains the authority to regulate and interact with that entity in specific ways.

The three most critical functions the straw man enables are:

### 1. Impose Duties

It allows the government to impose duties and obligations, such as taxes, on this public entity. These duties are seen as part of the franchise agreement that the individual voluntarily entered into.

### 2. Maintain Records

It provides a legal basis for the government to maintain records on an entity it created. This is presented as a way to bypass Fourth Amendment privacy concerns that would arise if the government were keeping such records on private individuals without their consent.

### 3. Transfer Property

It enables the government to use, benefit from, or tax property that an individual has voluntarily associated with the straw man public office. This converts otherwise private property into property with a "public interest" that can be regulated.

### 6. Conclusion: The Key Takeaway

The central takeaway is that the "straw man" concept is built upon the idea of a fundamental legal separation between a private, sovereign human and a created, public "person." This public person, or straw man, comes into existence through contracts and franchises with the government. It is this legal fiction—not the private, sovereign human—that is subject to statutory law and becomes the entity that engages with government and commercial systems. The critical insight of this framework is its reinterpretation of routine civil acts—such as applying for a license or Social Security—not as simple administrative procedures, but as profound contractual events that create a separate, governable legal 'person'.

## **A Legal Analysis of the Distinction Between Public and Private Rights**

### 1.0 Introduction: Defining the Scope of Analysis

This analysis provides a meticulous delineation of the legal distinction between **public rights**, identified as government-granted franchises, and **private rights**, defined as inherent Constitutional rights that pre-exist government itself. The central thesis of this examination is that the very foundation of legitimate, _de jure_ government is the protection of private property and rights. Any assault upon private capital is therefore not merely an economic matter but a direct threat to the constitutional order. As the Supreme Court warned in _Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co._,

:::highlight
"The present assault upon capital is but the beginning. It will be but the stepping stone to others larger and more sweeping, until our political contest will become war of the poor against the rich; a war of growing intensity and bitterness."
:::

This paper will examine the legal mechanisms—primarily contract and consent—through which private rights are voluntarily converted into public rights, thereby becoming subject to governmental regulation.

To achieve this, the analysis will proceed through a structured examination of several core legal concepts. It begins by establishing the foundational dichotomy between public and private rights. It then explores the legal nature of property, which embodies these rights, before deconstructing the franchise as the primary contractual instrument of conversion. Finally, it analyzes the legal construct of the statutory "person" as a public office, a key element in understanding the application of civil statutory law to the individual.

### 2.0 The Foundational Dichotomy: Public Rights vs. Private Rights

Understanding the fundamental legal separation between public and private rights is the cornerstone of American constitutional jurisprudence. This dichotomy posits two distinct categories of rights: one that is a creation of government and another that is a pre-existing, inherent right that government is formed to protect. The clear delineation between these two realms is critical to comprehending the limits of governmental authority and the nature of individual liberty.

#### Public Rights as Government Franchises

Legal precedent confirms that **public rights** are matters that "must at a minimum arise 'between the government and others.'" This definition, grounded in _Northern Pipeline Const. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co._, identifies these rights with government-created franchises. Critically, these are "rights created by Congress" as distinct from "rights recognized by the Constitution." Public rights are not inherent; they are privileges granted by a sovereign power, exist as a direct consequence of a transaction with the government, and may be adjudicated by administrative agencies outside the traditional Article III judicial power.

#### Private Rights as Constitutional Entitlements

In stark contrast, **private rights** are defined as "the liability of one individual to another under the law as defined." These rights are not granted by the government but are rooted in the Constitution and the common law. Synthesizing the arguments from _Hale v. Henkel_, the private individual is one who "owes nothing to the public so long as he does not trespass upon their rights." This individual "receives nothing" from the state beyond the general protection of life and property and is entitled to conduct his private business in his own way, free from governmental investigation.

#### The Purpose of Government

The foundational purpose of _de jure_ government is, therefore, the protection of "EXCLUSIVELY PRIVATE rights". It is not the source of rights, but the protector of pre-existing private rights. This principle is so fundamental that any assault upon private capital and property constitutes an existential threat to the constitutional order. As the Court articulated in _Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co._:

:::highlight
"Here I close my opinion. I could not say less in view of questions of such gravity that they go down to the very foundations of the government. If the provisions of the Constitution can be set aside by an act of Congress, where is the course of usurpation to end?"
:::

This theoretical distinction between public and private rights finds its practical application in the legal treatment of property itself.

### 3.0 The Nature of Property in American Law

To comprehend the practical application of public versus private rights, one must first understand how "property" is defined within the legal context. The term encompasses far more than tangible assets; it is the legal vessel for the rights themselves. This section explores the expansive legal definition of property and differentiates between the characteristics of its PUBLIC and PRIVATE forms.

#### The Expansive Definition of Property

Drawing from _Black’s Law Dictionary, Fifth Edition_, property is defined as an expansive legal term that "embraces everything which is or may be the subject of ownership." This broad definition includes not only real and personal property but also "every species of valuable right and interest," such as easements, franchises, and other incorporeal hereditaments. In this framework, rights and property are inextricably linked; a right is a form of property, and anything that conveys rights, such as a contract or franchise, is also considered property.

#### A Comparative Framework

The distinction between public and private property is critical. PUBLIC property is a qualified ownership created by government grant, whereas PRIVATE property is an absolute ownership derived from natural law and protected by the Bill of Rights. The following table summarizes these core distinctions.

**Table 1: Comparison of Public and Private Property**

| **Public Property**                                                            | **Private Property**                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authority for ownership:** Grantor/creator of franchise                      | **Authority for ownership:** God/natural law          |
| **Type of ownership:** Qualified                                               | **Type of ownership:** Absolute                       |
| **Law protecting ownership:** Statutory franchises                             | **Law protecting ownership:** Bill of Rights          |

| **Ownership is a:** Privilege/franchise                                        | **Ownership is a:** Right                             |
| **Courts protecting ownership:** Franchise court                               | **Courts protecting ownership:** Constitutional court |
| **Basis for taxation:** Voluntary donation of the property to a public use     | **Basis for taxation:** None                          |

#### The Conversion of Private Property to Public Use

A government's primary function is to keep private property separate from public property. In _Budd v. People of State of New York_, the Supreme Court established the clear rules governing the conversion of private property to a public use. Such a conversion cannot be compelled and requires the voluntary consent of the owner, except in specific cases of eminent domain or criminal activity. The rules for this conversion are as follows:

1. The owner of justly acquired property enjoys full and exclusive use and control over it.
2. The owner may not use the property to injure the equal rights of his neighbor.
3. The owner cannot be compelled to use his property to benefit his neighbor.
4. If the owner voluntarily donates the property to a public use, he gives the public the right to control that use.
5. When public needs require, the public may take the property without consent upon payment of just compensation (eminent domain).

The legal consequence of this voluntary conversion is profound. As the Court reasoned in _Munn v. Illinois_, when an owner "devotes his property to a use in which the public has an interest, he, in effect, grants to the public an interest in that use, and must submit to be controlled by the public for the common good."

Understanding this principle of consensual conversion is essential, as it sets the stage for examining the specific legal mechanisms through which this transformation from private to public status occurs.

### 4.0 The Conversion Mechanism: Contracts and Franchises

The critical role of contract and consent mediates the relationship between the private individual and the government. It is through voluntary agreements that an individual transitions from the private sphere, protected by the Constitution, to the public sphere, regulated by statute. This section deconstructs the legal framework of the **franchise** as the primary contractual instrument for converting private rights into public ones.

#### The Franchise as a Contract

A franchise is defined in _36 American Jurisprudence 2d, Franchises_ as a contract "between the sovereign power and private citizens, made upon valuable considerations, for purposes of individual advantage as well as public benefit." It is a negotiated agreement wherein an individual receives certain privileges from the government—such as professional licenses, business licenses, driver licenses, marriage licenses, or government "benefits" like Social Security—and, in return, agrees to be bound by the rules and regulations governing that franchise.

#### Legal Consequences of Acceptance

The legal consequence of accepting a franchise is a voluntary submission to public control. The Supreme Court's reasoning in _Munn v. Illinois_ is central to this point: when one "devotes his property to a use in which the public has an interest, he, in effect, grants to the public an interest in that use, and must submit to be controlled by the public for the common good." By entering into the franchise contract, the individual consents to place what was once purely private property or activity under the regulatory authority of the government.

#### The "Straw Man" as a Legal Entity

This contractual process creates a legal entity, or public office, which is the actual party to the franchise agreement. This entity is legally defined as a **straw man**. Citing _Black’s Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition_, a **straw man** is defined as a "front" or a "nominal party to a transaction." In this context, the **straw man** is the artificial "person" created by law to serve as the franchisee. It is a form of identity laundering—or, more accurately, identity THEFT—that allows for the regulation of otherwise exclusively PRIVATE conduct.

By entering into a franchise contract, the private individual agrees to act as surety for this public office. In doing so, they voluntarily adopt the legal status of a "person" subject to the specific statutory laws that govern that particular franchise. This "straw man," this "nominal party to a transaction," is the very same legal entity referred to as a "person" or "individual" in civil statutes.

The analysis now transitions from the general mechanism of the franchise to a more detailed examination of the legal status of the "person" that this mechanism creates.

### 5.0 The Legal Construct of the "Person" as a Public Office

Within this legal framework, the statutory term "person" is a specific legal construct, not a simple synonym for a human being. It is a "word of art" that refers to a public office created by and subject to the government. This section analyzes the legal evidence defining this statutory "person" as a public office, for which a private human being voluntarily acts as an agent or surety.

#### Statutory Definitions

Key statutory definitions confirm this legal reality. The term "trade or business" in **26 U.S.C. §7701(a)(26)** is defined to include "the performance of the functions of a public office." This directly links a primary taxable activity under the Internal Revenue Code to the exercise of a public function.

Furthermore, statutory terms such as "person," "individual," and "taxpayer" are legal terms referring to these public offices. The definitions of "person" in **26 U.S.C. §6671(b)** and **§7343** are particularly instructive, defining the term to include "an officer or employee of a corporation... under a duty to perform the act." This establishes the statutory "person" not as a natural being, but as a legal entity with specific duties tied to a corporate or public function.

#### Legal Implications of the Distinction

This distinction carries profound legal implications. Citing _Hale v. Henkel_, the analysis contrasts the rights of the private "individual" with the obligations of the public "corporation" (or its officers). The private individual "receives nothing" from the state beyond general protection and "owes no such duty to the state." The corporation, however, is a "creature of the state" that receives "special privileges and franchises" and is therefore subject to the will of its creator, the legislature. An officer of that corporation, acting in a public capacity, is similarly bound by the statutory duties associated with that office.

This legal framework thus establishes two parallel but distinct identities: the sovereign human being, whose rights are inherent and protected by the Constitution and common law, and the statutory "person," a public officer created by and subject to the franchise law of the government.

### 6.0 Conclusion

This analysis has delineated the fundamental legal distinctions between public and private rights. Public rights are defined as government-created franchises, which are privileges granted by contract. Private rights are identified as inherent, pre-existing Constitutional rights that a legitimate government is formed to protect. The core function of government, in this view, is to secure these private rights, which are embodied in the concept of private property.

The central argument is that the conversion of private rights and property into public ones, subject to governmental regulation, is a voluntary process. This transformation is predicated on the foundational legal principles of contract and consent. An individual's subjection to civil statutory law is not inherent but is acquired through the knowing and voluntary acceptance of a government franchise.

Ultimately, this legal framework posits that this acceptance creates a public office, or a legal "person," for which the private individual then agrees to act as a willing surety. It is in this capacity—as a public officer acting within the terms of a specific franchise—that an individual becomes subject to the corresponding body of civil statutory law.

## **A Policy Paper on the Jurisdictional Limits of Government Authority Over Private Individuals**

### 1.0 The Foundational Principles of Sovereignty and Consent

American governance is built upon a revolutionary premise: that legitimate power flows not from the government down to the people, but from sovereign individuals up to the government they create. Understanding this principle is strategically critical, as it establishes that governmental authority is not inherent but is a temporary delegation granted by the consent of the governed. This foundational concept, articulated in the Declaration of Independence and affirmed in foundational legal thought, serves as the ultimate check on the scope and reach of state power. Any exercise of authority that deviates from this principle is not merely an overreach but a betrayal of the nation's core political philosophy.

The Declaration of Independence posits that governments are "instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed." This is not a political platitude but a statement of jurisdictional fact. The U.S. Supreme Court, in its early ruling in _Chisholm v. Georgia_, reinforced this by stating, "Sovereignty itself is, of course, not subject to law, for it is the author and source of law." In the American system, the people are sovereign, and the government is their agent. As sovereigns, individuals are the source of law, not its default subjects. Consequently, any government power that does not originate from the explicit or implicit consent of the governed is inherently unjust.

The sole legitimate purpose of this delegated power was articulated by Thomas Jefferson in his First Inaugural Address: a government that shall "restrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement." This defines a government with a purely protective, or negative, function. Its purpose is to shield individuals from harm by others, not to impose affirmative duties upon them. This principle is not merely a preference for liberty; it is a constitutional command. The imposition of any affirmative duty by the government upon a private individual, outside of punishment for a crime, is a direct violation of the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition against involuntary servitude.

This principle is further clarified in the Supreme Court's analysis in _Hale v. Henkel_. The Court distinguished between a private individual and a corporation, which is a creature of the state. It concluded that the private individual "owes no duty to the state...since he receives nothing therefrom, beyond the protection of his life and property." These rights to life and property are not grants from the government but are pre-existing, natural rights that government is formed to protect. Therefore, so long as a private individual does not trespass upon the rights of others, they owe no affirmative duty to the state that would grant the state jurisdiction over their private affairs.

This fundamental distinction between the sovereign individual and the government created to serve them establishes a critical jurisdictional boundary between public and private rights.

### 2.0 The Jurisdictional Boundary: An Analysis of Public vs. Private Rights

The constitutional concept of limited government is given practical effect through a strict legal and jurisdictional separation between the public and private spheres. This boundary is not merely a theoretical construct; it is the primary legal safeguard against the encroachment of government power into the lives of individuals. Understanding this distinction is therefore of paramount strategic importance, as it defines the areas where government may lawfully act and, more importantly, where it is forbidden to tread without the express consent of the individual.

The U.S. Supreme Court has provided a framework for this distinction by differentiating between "public rights" and "private rights." In cases like _Northern Pipeline Const. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co._, the Court defined a matter of public rights as one that must, at a minimum, arise "between the government and others." These are often privileges or franchises granted by the government. In contrast, a matter of private rights involves "the liability of one individual to another under the law as defined." The source text argues that public rights are created by statute and involve a relationship with the government, whereas private rights are pre-existing, recognized by the Constitution, and form the core of historically recognized judicial power.

This distinction imposes clear constitutional limitations on the government's ability to regulate private conduct. The source text asserts that the power to "legislate generally upon" the life, liberty, and property of private individuals is "repugnant to the constitution." Government action is only constitutionally permissible when it involves a "public function" or is so intertwined with "governmental authority" that it becomes a form of state action, as explored in _Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Company_. Absent a connection to a public right, franchise, or function voluntarily entered into by an individual, the government has no authority to regulate or impose duties.

The conceptual difference between the public and private spheres extends directly to the legal understanding of property. The following table contrasts the two based on definitions from _Black's Law Dictionary_ and analysis within the source context:

| Characteristic               | Public Property                                                                                           | Private Property                                           |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authority for Ownership**  | Grantor/creator of franchise                                                                              | God/natural law                                            |
| **Type of Ownership**        | Qualified                                                                                                 | Absolute                                                   |
| **Law Protecting Ownership** | Statutory franchises                                                                                      | Bill of Rights (First Ten Amendments to U.S. Constitution) |
| **Owner**                    | The public (legal owner) and the individual (equitable owner), with the individual acting as **Trustee**. | The individual (absolute legal and equitable owner)        |

The central problem this paper addresses is how the government systematically circumvents this critical jurisdictional boundary through the sophisticated use of legal fictions.

### 3.0 The "Straw Man": A Legal Fiction as a Bridge to Jurisdiction

To bridge the jurisdictional gap between the public and private spheres, the government employs a sophisticated legal device referred to in the source material as the "straw man." Understanding this legal fiction is strategically critical for recognizing how civil jurisdiction is asserted over sovereign individuals who would otherwise remain outside its reach. The "straw man" is not a person in the natural sense but an artificial, legal entity—a fiction—created to stand in for the private individual in the public, commercial, and legal realms.

_Black's Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition_, provides a definition that illuminates this concept:

**Straw man.** A "front"; a third party who is put up in name only to take part in a transaction. Nominal party to a transaction; one who acts as an agent for another for the purpose of taking title to real property and executing whatever documents and instruments the principal may direct respecting the property. Person who purchases property, or to accomplish some purpose otherwise not allowed.

This definition establishes three core criteria for the existence of a "straw man":

1. A commercial transaction involving property.
2. The action of an agent on behalf of a principal.
3. The acquisition of property by a party that would otherwise not be lawfully permitted to do so.

The source material synthesizes this concept by arguing that the "straw man" is a "public office" and a "fiction of law." As a 'fiction of law,' the 'person' is a legal assumption—a presumption that something is true which may in fact be false—created to enable the government to exercise jurisdiction where it otherwise could not. The most common form this public office takes is that of a statutory "person." The state, being unable to regulate the men and women it did not create, instead created the office of "person"—an artificial entity over which it retains absolute authority. By persuading a private individual to act as the agent for, or "occupy," this public office, the state establishes a legal basis for regulation that would otherwise be unconstitutional.

This legal framework is explicitly codified in federal tax law. The link between the "straw man" public office and civil liability is found in the definition of a "trade or business." According to `26 U.S.C. §7701(a)(26)`, the term "trade or business" _includes_ "the performance of the functions of a public office." Therefore, when an individual engages in a statutory "trade or business," they are, by definition, performing the duties of a public officer and are acting as the "straw man."

The mechanism through which a sovereign individual voluntarily, if unwittingly, agrees to occupy this "public office" and act as a "straw man" is through their participation in government-created franchises.

### 4.0 The Vehicle of Consent: Government Franchises and Quasi-Contracts

Consent is the only legitimate channel through which a sovereign individual can become subject to civil statutory law. Because direct compulsion is constitutionally forbidden as a form of involuntary servitude, the government must obtain this consent indirectly. This section deconstructs the primary vehicles for securing that consent: government franchises and the legal fiction of quasi-contracts.

A "franchise" is defined as a contract between the government (the grantor) and a private individual (the grantee), which confers a special "public right" or "privilege" that does not exist at common law. Critically, the acceptance of the "benefit" offered by a franchise is legally equivalent to consenting to all the obligations that come with it. The Supreme Court affirmed this principle in , where it established that the Court will not hear a constitutional challenge to a statute from a party who has already accepted its benefits. By applying for and using a government-issued number, license, or benefit, an individual enters into a franchise contract, thereby creating a legal 'res'—a public office or status—over which the government has jurisdiction.

Several common government franchises serve this purpose, transforming private individuals into public officers subject to civil regulation:

- **Social Security:** By applying for a Social Security Number (SSN), an individual creates a trust relationship with the government, where the individual becomes a trustee over public property (the SSN) and its associated transactions.
- **Driver's Licenses:** This franchise characterizes the licensed "driver" not as a private individual exercising a right to travel, but as a public officer engaged in commercial activity on public roads, thereby consenting to the jurisdiction of the vehicle code.
- **Marriage Licenses:** A marriage license transforms a private union into a three-party contract between the man, the woman, and the State, making the State a "silent partner" with jurisdiction to regulate the family and its property.
- **Bank FDIC Insurance:** This franchise converts private banks into "agents" and "financial agents of the Federal Government," compelling them to perform public duties like surveillance in exchange for the benefit of federal insurance.

Where no express contract or franchise exists, the government may invoke the legal fiction of a "quasi-contract." A quasi-contract is not a real contract based on mutual consent but an obligation created by a court to prevent unjust enrichment. It is used to impose duties "as though there had been a promise" when an individual engages in "purposeful availment" of the benefits or protections of statutory law. By invoking the protections of a statutory system, an individual is treated as having consented to its obligations, even in the absence of a signed agreement.

The next section will explore the tangible consequences of this framework of presumed consent, particularly how the government uses it to lawfully tax individuals and maintain records on their activities.

### 5.0 Consequences of Presumed Consent: Taxation and Surveillance

This framework of consent through franchise has profound consequences, reframing taxation and government record-keeping not as universal civic duties, but as specific obligations that attach exclusively to the "straw man" public office. Understanding this distinction is strategically vital, as it challenges the presumed legitimacy of widespread tax enforcement and data collection by asserting that such powers are strictly limited to those who have voluntarily entered the public sphere.

The source material deconstructs the legal basis for taxation by citing the Supreme Court's ruling in _Loan Association v. Topeka_, which held that government cannot lawfully tax private parties to bestow funds upon other private parties, calling such an act "robbery." For tax and benefit systems like the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Subtitle A and Social Security to be lawful, their participants _must_ be legally classified as public officers. The source argues that this is why the Privacy Act, `5 U.S.C. §552a(a)(13)`, defines those receiving federal retirement benefits—including Social Security—as "Federal personnel." The payment of taxes into the system and the receipt of benefits from it are functions of a public office, not a private transaction.

Information returns, such as IRS Forms W-2 and 1099, are identified as the primary mechanism for unlawfully converting private property to a public use. These forms connect private earnings to a "trade or business," which, as previously established (`26 U.S.C. §7701(a)(26)`), is legally defined as "the functions of a public office." According to the source's analysis, for a third party to file such a return against a private individual who has not consented to occupy a public office is tantamount to impersonating a public officer (`18 U.S.C. §912`) and filing a false statement (`26 U.S.C. §7206`). The act of filing the return is a legal declaration that the individual is a public officer and their earnings are public funds.

Similarly, the government's authority to maintain records is not absolute. The Fourth Amendment protects the right of private parties to be secure in their "papers, and effects," which includes private information. The Privacy Act (`5 U.S.C. §552a`) authorizes the government to maintain records systems, but its protections and permissions apply only to a statutory "individual," defined within the Act as "a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence." Crucially, this is a legal term of art, not a reference to every natural person. It designates a specific civil status—that of a public actor domiciled on federal territory—distinct from the status of a private individual within one of the states of the Union.

Given these systemic jurisdictional infringements, specific policy changes are required to restore the foundational principles of limited government and the clear boundary between public and private life.

### 6.0 Policy Recommendations and Conclusion

This paper has argued that the legitimate authority of government has been improperly and systematically expanded by conflating the sovereign private individual with a fictitious public office, referred to as the "straw man." This has been achieved primarily through the use of government franchises and legal fictions that presume consent, thereby nullifying the jurisdictional boundary that is the bedrock of constitutional liberty. This final section offers concrete policy recommendations designed to re-establish these clear boundaries and restore the principle of a government that derives its just powers from the governed.

1. **Mandate Jurisdictional Disclosures.** Require all government forms, applications, and legal filings to explicitly state the civil status ("public officer" or "private individual") being addressed and the specific, consensual basis for the assertion of jurisdiction. This would eliminate ambiguity and prevent the government from trapping individuals through deceptive "words of art" and unstated legal presumptions.
2. **Establish a Clear "Opt-Out" of Public Franchises.** Create a formal, legally recognized, and unambiguous process for individuals to terminate their participation in all non-criminal government franchises, such as Social Security. This would affirm that consent, to be legitimate, must be revocable, allowing individuals to revert to a purely private status and escape the obligations of a public office they no longer wish to occupy.
3. **Reform Information Reporting Laws.** Amend tax and banking statutes to require the explicit, written, and informed consent of an individual before any third party can file an information return (e.g., W-2, 1099) that legally associates them with a "trade or business" or "public office." This would prevent the non-consensual and fraudulent conversion of private property into public property subject to taxation and regulation.
4. **Codify the Burden of Proof for Consent.** Enact legislation that places the burden of proof squarely on the government in any civil proceeding to produce clear, unambiguous evidence of an individual's voluntary consent to the specific franchise or public status being enforced. This would shift the legal default from presumed submission back to the foundational principle of individual sovereignty, forcing the state to justify its jurisdiction rather than compelling the individual to disprove it.

In conclusion, the erosion of the boundary between the private individual and the public sphere represents one of the most significant threats to liberty. The "straw man" fiction, created through franchises and presumed consent, has allowed a government of limited, delegated powers to assume nearly unlimited regulatory authority over the very sovereigns it was created to serve. Restoring the principles of American governance requires not only a renewed appreciation for these foundational ideas but also the implementation of clear legal safeguards. Ultimately, the preservation of liberty depends on the vigilance of the people and a legal framework that is transparent, honest, and steadfast in its defense of the distinction between the sovereign and the servant.
