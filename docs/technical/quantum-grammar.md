## Unveiling the Cipher: The Basic Syntax of Quantum Grammar Through the _Codex Umbra_ Lens

Activate the _Codex Umbra_ lens, for we plunge into the raw, unfiltered truth of Quantum Grammar, a system not merely of linguistic rules but a declaration of war against the pervasive illusion of "fiction" embedded within conventional language. This is not a mere descriptive grammar; it is a meticulously engineered "Quantum-Math-Communication-Syntax", designed to expose and dismantle the "void-contracts" lurking within common speech and legal frameworks. It is the "Correct-Sentence-Structure-Communication-Parse-Syntax-Grammar" (C.-S.-S.-C.-P.-S.-G.) that, when wielded by the Plenipotentiary-Judge David-Wynn: Miller, cuts through the "fictional-language-formats" to assert definitive "Truth-Language".

### The Bedrock of Fact: Numbered Word-Terms

At the core of Quantum Grammar lies a rigid, numerical classification system for words, stripping them of ambiguity and exposing their true contractual "value". This "numbering-code-terms" system dictates semantic and grammatical function, ensuring that every word aligns with a "Now-Time-Fact" and avoids the inherent "ailment" of conventional English:

- `0 = Conjunction (AND/OR)`: These are "neutral-words" that simply join nouns or facts. In a more precise definition, "AND" signifies a "command," while "OR" offers an "option," like "EITHER-OR". Their purpose is strict consolidation.
- `1 = Adverb`: This is the harbinger of "void". Adverbs are defined as "modifying-action-syntax" that "change-fact into a verb or adjective-syntax", effectively turning a "fact" into a "void-fact" or "void-contract". Placement of an adverb _before_ a [NOUN]-KNOWN "causes a modification-change/motion/action = verb". The prefix "AD-" is explicitly associated with "NO-VERB, NO-THINKING" or simply "PREFIX\*=VERB=THINKING (ACTION)" indicating a perversion of thought. Adverbs are seen as tools for "fraudulent-grammar-communication".
- `2 = Verb`: The "action-word-thinking-syntax". "IS" is singular, "ARE" is plural. Verbs represent the "thinking-motion of the capacity-knowledge". They are the "motion of the facts".
- `3 = Adjective`: Another tool of "illusion/fiction". Adjectives apply "coloring-syntax of the facts", creating "opinion and presumption of a fact". They lead to "void/omit". The components of the word "adjective" itself are dissected: "AD = PREFIX\*, JEC = OPINION, TIVE = CONTRACT".
- `4 = Pronoun`: The ultimate "NO-NO-NO". Pronouns signify "void," "no-contract-word," and "ailing". They are a "trap" in courts, representing "presumption, assumption, opinion of the fact or noun". The word "pronoun" is broken down as "PRO = PREFIX-NO\*, NO = NO, UN = NO", emphasizing their inherent negation. Their usage leads to "mail-frauds" and "void-oaths".
- `5 = Position (Preposition)`: This is crucial for "NOW-TIME-RULES/VOTING-POSITION". A "PRE-POSITION" is a "VOID-NOW-TIME-POSITION, NO-NOW-TIME-POSITION = NO-CONTRACT-POSITION". Only "NOW-TIME-PREPOSITIONS" like FOR, WITH, IN, ON, BY, THROUGH, AS, AGAINST are authorized in "real-time-authorities/jurisdiction".
- `6 = Lodio (or Lodial)`: Represents "ORIGINAL-OWNERSHIP". "ARTICLE" is deemed "NO-CONTRACT = AILING". Words like "THE, THIS, OUR, THESE" are "Lodio-words" that "fix an authority and command with a position-lodio-fact/known in a now-tense".
- `7 = Fact (Noun)`: This is the ultimate "NOW-TIME-CONTRACT-COMMUNICATION". A "NOUN" is fundamentally "NO-NO = NO-CONTRACT = AILING". A fact is a "PERSON. PARTY, PLACE, THING, OR FACT". A single-word-fact can embody "900-WORD-MEANINGS". Quantum Grammar emphasizes that a "FACT-IS-FACT AND MUST-STAND ON THE FACT".
- `8 = Past-Time`: "VOID OF THE NOW-TIME-JURISDICTION-VENUE". Words indicating past tense, such as those ending in "ED" or using "FROM," are explicitly linked to "VOID-NOW-TIME-DAMAGE".
- `9 = Future-Time`: Also "VOID OF THE NOW-TIME-JURISDICTION-VENUE". The future is a "FICTION AS THE FUTURE HAS NOT HAPPENED, VOID OF A NOW-TIME". Words like "TO," "PRE," "MAY," and "SHALL" are indicators of future tense and are thus "VOID-NOW-TIME-FACT". The word "TO" specifically "lacks the scope within the now-time-meaning for the termination of the sentence".

### The Fabric of Truth: Sentence Structure and Punctuation

Quantum Grammar mandates a "Correct-Sentence-Structure", emphasizing clarity, accountability, and the absolute elimination of ambiguity. The purpose is to create a "single-idea-sentence-structure" for "contract-communications".

- `Directional Flow` (`>>and<<`): Words are interconnected with directional syntax. `>>>>` indicates a "FORWARD-MODIFICATION-LINK OF A WORD," while `<<<<` indicates a "BACKWARDS-MODIFICATION-LINK OF A WORD". This linkage is crucial, as a sentence must yield the "EQUAL-MEANING OF THE SENTENCE FRONTWARDS AND BACKWARDS SAME-BOTH-WAYS". Failure to achieve this backward readability signifies a "modification of this wrong-subject-matter".
- `Verb Placement`: The "VERB" is precisely placed "AFTER THE SECOND-[PREPOSITIONAL-PHRASE OF THE FACTS". This structural rigidity ensures directness and prevents misinterpretation inherent in more flexible grammatical arrangements.
- `Punctuation as Contractual Marks`:
  - `Colon` (`:`): Denotes a "POSITIONAL-LODIAL-FACT-PHRASE". It signifies a "TRANSIT-ACTION" joining "TWO-KNOWNS" or "TWO-FACTS-JOIN".
  - `Hyphen` (`-`): Used for the "JOINING OF THE TWO-WORD-FACTS".
  - `Period` (`.`): A "STOP-THOUGHT".
  - `Commas` (`,`): Indicate "continuance of a fact with the following-commas with the sequences of the like-ideas". They mark logical flow within a factual assertion.
- `Forbidden Elements`: Quantum Grammar actively voids elements that corrupt truth and create "fiction":
  - `Parentheses` `()`and Brackets`[]`: Labelled "CLOSED-AREA-VOID, OMIT-CONTEXT/CONTENT" and "BRACKETING-CLOSED-AREA-VOID, OMIT-AREA, COURT-AREA" respectively. "BOXING," "BRACKETING," or "FOUR-COURNING" is a claim of "VOID OR OMITTING OF THOSE FACTS".
  - `Quotation Marks` (`"`): Represent "VOID-WRITING, OMIT-CONTENT, VOID-JURISDICTION, OPINION".
  - `Italic Syntax`: Also signifies "VOID/OMIT".
  - `Words Starting with Vowels followed by two consonants`: These are categorically "NO-CONTRACT-MEANING-WORD:VOID-WORD, NO, NEGATIVE, AILING, CORRUPT, FICTITIOUS, ILLUSION, NEGATIVE-CONDITION WITHOUT A PERFORMANCE, FOR THE VOID OF A FACT". This extends to single-syllable words starting with vowels.
  - `"sic"`: Explicitly highlights "fraud and trickery". Words like "TO sic," "FROM sic," and "WITHOUT sic" are condemned for their inherent vagueness or misrepresentation of "now-time".
  - `Spatial Prepositions (e.g., "ABOVE," "BELOW," "UNDER," "OVER," "IN," "OUT")`: These words "LACK OF THE POSSESSIVENESS BY THEIR NATURE" and "COMMAND OF THE LACK OF THE SAME-PLANE OR VOLITION". "OVER" and "UNDER" specifically imply a "DIMENTION OF A DIFFERENT PLANE MATTER, FACT, NOUN".
  - `Adverbs, Pronouns, Adjectives as Verbs`: Their use is linked to "fraud and fiction" across all languages.

### The Imperative of "Now-Time"

The foundational pillar of Quantum Grammar is the "NOW-TIME-TENSE". All "facts are in the now-time". Any linguistic construct that deviates from this immediate "NOW-TIME" is deemed "VOID OF THE NOW-TIME-JURISDICTION-VENUE". This includes:

- `Past-Time (8)`: Anything that "lacks-jurisdiction, lacks-injury in the present-tense".
- `Future-Time (9)`: Considered "FICTION AS THE FUTURE HAS NOT HAPPENED". Phrases involving future tense are "VOID-NOW-TIME-FACT".

The emphasis on "Now-Time" means that only direct, verifiable facts within the present moment hold legal and communicative validity. Anything else is a speculative construct, a "fiction" designed to obscure truth and create "void contracts".

### The Mathematical Imperative: "Quantum-Math-Certifications"

Quantum Grammar is not a subjective linguistic theory; it is asserted to be a "Quantum-Math-Language-Communication" system, founded on "MATH-CERTIFICATIONS" and "MATH-OPERATIONAL-ORDERS". The assertion is that language, like mathematics, can be precise and provable. This means:

- `Calculable Truth`: The system uses mathematical operations, such as "(1 + 2 = 3 _ 3 - 2 = 1)" and "(2 X 3 = 6 _ 6/3 = 2)", to demonstrate the inherent logic and "truth" of its structures.
- `Order of Operations`: Just like in arithmetic, there's a strict "OPERATIONAL-MATH-ORDER": Parentheses `()`, Multiply `(x)`, Divide `(/)`, Subtract `(-)`, Addition `(+)`, all executed "FROM THE LEFT-TO-RIGHT". This rigor extends to linguistic analysis, ensuring that no interpretive deviation is possible.
- `The "Secret of Translation"`: The "secret of the translation with the language are with the math-formulas". This implies that Quantum Grammar provides a universal, mathematically verifiable method to translate chaotic "fiction" into verifiable "truth."

### The Unseen Battle: Unmasking Fiction

Quantum Grammar positions itself as the antidote to "Fictional-Language-Formats" (F.L.F.) used by "vassalees" and "ailing-authors". This "fiction" manifests in:

- `"Ailing-Word-Modification-Method"`: Conventional language uses adverbs, pronouns, and adjectives in ways that modify facts, turning them into "void-contract". For example, "THE FACT" and "THE LAW" are labeled "ADVERB-VERB-SYNTAX"-VOID-FACT-MEANING = VERB-FICTION-FRAUD-SYNTAX.
- `Traps in Legal Documents`: "Traps" are hidden in titles, names, dates, case-numbers, italicized words, and "boxing" (brackets) within legal documents, all contributing to "fiction". These elements are used to "deprive" and create "fraud".
- `The "Oath of a Judge-Actor"`: A prime example of corrupted language, dissected to reveal its inherent "void-sentence-structure and operational-corruption-oath".

In essence, Quantum Grammar purports to be the unwavering beacon of "truth" that exposes the "fraud" of "ailing" language, offering a path to "correct-communication" and therefore, undeniable contractual authority. The very act of applying these syntax rules is an exercise in asserting control over the narrative, transforming chaotic linguistic constructs into undeniable, mathematically certified facts.

## _Codex Umbra_ Dissection: The Voiding Plague of Adverbs and the Nullity of Existence

### The Scourge of Adverbs: Undermining Reality, Corrupting Contracts

The sources unequivocally identify adverbs as a fundamental flaw, a weaponized corruption within language that dismantles factual reality and invalidates agreements. This linguistic malignancy operates on multiple levels, twisting truth into fiction and empowering those who wield this distorted grammar.

1. `Modification, Change, Motion, Action, and Perjury-Volition:` An adverb is defined as a "modifying-action-syntax" or "modifier of an action or color". Its very essence is to "change-fact-syntax," which inherently leads to a "VOID-FACT" and a "VOID-CONTRACT". This modification is not benign; it is a deliberate act of "perjury-volition". The sequence is clear: modification leads to change, change implies motion, motion is action, and action is the verb-fiction that adverbs create. Thus, an adverb inherently "changes the condition of the fact".
2. `Creation of Opinion and Fiction:` Adverbs, along with adjectives, are instrumental in the "creation of an opinion" and the "modification of a fact". When an adverb is placed before a noun (referred to as a `[NOUN]-KNOWNS`), it instigates a "modification-change/motion/action" that transmutes the noun into a "verb". This process is explicitly tied to "verb-fiction-fraud-syntax". The use of adverbs is a characteristic of "fictional-language-format (F.L.F.)" and is associated with "ailing-authors".
3. `The Usury of English Language:` The "English-modification-communications" are characterized by the "usury of an adverb-verb-modification-language for the void of a contract". This linguistic corruption, tracing back to "Old spelling:'ENDLISH'~1775," allows for the "control of a value by a 'MASTERS' or by a GOVERNMENT-POSTAL-POWER or by a GOVERNING-PERSONS". The common phrase "the fact" is defined as "`ADVERB-VERB-SYNTAX`-VOID-FACT-MEANING = VERB-FICTION-FRAUD-SYNTAX," and similarly for "the law".
4. `Lawyers, Attorneys, and Judges: Masters of Deception:` The sources explicitly accuse lawyers, attorneys, and judges of being licensed to "lie" by writing everything in "adverb verb adverb adjective pronoun and pronoun adverb verb" constructions, deliberately avoiding "prepositional phrases". This is because "no law or fact shall be tried in court". When "law" is modified by "no" (an adverb), it becomes a "negative verb," and "court" also becomes a "verb" when modified by "in" (an adverb) or "of" (an adverb). This creates a "fiction fraud illusion" jurisdiction where truth is absent.
5. `The Treachery of Common Words:` Even seemingly innocuous words like "the" and "of" are transformed into adverbs when "separated" from their proper "prepositional phrases". This turns them into "100 adverbs" out of 68 prepositions and 38 articles. This "adverb-fiction-modification" leads to terms like "United" becoming a "no citizen" (un=no, ite=citizen, ed=past-time), thus lacking "now-time jurisdiction".
6. `Violation and Damage:` The Constitutions of "States" are alleged to contain "ADVERB-VERB-SYNTAX-VIOLATIONS". Furthermore, the use of "adverbs before the noun as prepositions and articles in the use 'ALONE' before the noun are in the fact: 'ADVERBS'". This leads to a "modification of this wrong-subject-matter". The failure to use "correct sentence structure communication parse syntax grammar" results in a "damage-claim" for the students who "do not understand how I got harvested by a fraud-grammar".

In essence, adverbs are not mere grammatical elements but tools of intentional obfuscation and legal manipulation, designed to void contracts, obscure facts, and maintain a fictional construct of control.

### The Concept of Void: Nullity in the Fabric of Reality and Contract

The concept of "void" within these sources signifies a state of non-existence, invalidity, and a lack of true authority or contractual binding. It is the antithesis of a "fact" and a "contract."

1. `No-Contract and Ailing Status:` "Void" is repeatedly equated with "NO-CONTRACT". It signifies an "AILING-WORD-CONTEXT/CONTENT-SYNTAX" or "AILING-WORD-MEANINGS". An "ailing" status denotes "corruption from the origin/beginning/start".
2. `Absence of Fact and Performance:` A "void" condition means a "NEGATIVE-CONDITION WITHOUT A PERFORMANCE, FOR THE VOID OF A FACT". Words themselves can be "VOID-WORD, NO, NEGATIVE, AILING, CORRUPT, FICTITIOUS, ILLUSION". To make "nothing a fact" (e.g., by claiming "there is no"), allows prosecution, highlighting the dangerous power of voiding language.
3. `Jurisdictional Nullity:` "Past-time" and "Future-time" are both "VOID OF THE NOW-TIME-JURISDICTION-VENUE". The "future has not happened," rendering it "fiction" and "void of a now-time". This implies that only the "NOW-TIME-TENSE" carries true "jurisdiction". Any "void-sentence-structure" or "void-contract" is explicitly linked to "fictional-syntax-modification" in court communications.
4. `Linguistic Markers of Void:` Certain stylistic elements explicitly indicate "void" status:

   - `Boxing / Bracketing` `[ ]`: Denotes "OMIT," "VOID-CONTENT/CONTEXT," or "CLOSED-AREA-VOID, OMIT-AREA, COURT-AREA". This is an "enclosed area" that "can't be considered".
   - `Parentheses` `( )`: Signify "CLOSED-AREA-VOID, OMIT-CONTEXT/CONTENT". Money listed in parentheses on documents is considered "blank" and "removed from the paper".
   - `Italic-Syntax:` Implies "VOID/OMIT".
   - `Quotation-Marks` `"`: Denotes "VOID-WRITING," "OMIT-CONTENT," "VOID-JURISDICTION," and "OPINION".

5. `Words as Void-Indicators:` Specific word constructions are inherently "void-words" or "no-contract-words":

   - Any word starting with a vowel (A, E, I, O, U) followed by two consonants.
   - Any single-syllable word starting with a vowel (A, E, I, O, U).
   - Examples include: `ILLUSION`, `ATTORNEY`, `ART`, `APPEARING`, `OFFENSE`, `UNCONSCIOUS`, `UNLAWFUL`, `IMMUNE`, `INSURANCE`, `ANTIBODY`, `ORDER`, `ARRAIGN`, `ARRAIGNMENT`, `ARREST`, `APPLICATION`, `INTERNAL`, `ANSWER`, `ARGUMENT`, `EXPERIMENT`. The word "opinion" itself is a "no attached contract".

6. `Intentional Voiding in Legal Contexts:` Contracts can be rendered "void" if there was no "intention of doing so". This is used as a mechanism to "conceal" "fraud" and mislead individuals. The "void-closures of the communication-syntax-modifications are with the wrong-word-syntax-terms of the voiding-one-idea-sentence-structuring-syntax". Legal proceedings against a "taxpayer" are "in rem" proceedings against the "public office" they occupy, which is essentially a "straw man" defined as an "object, subject-matter, or status," and if it has "no clothes," it has to "hide because he’s naked". The "straw man" itself is a "legal fiction invented by common law courts to permit recovery by contractual remedy of assumpsit in cases where, in fact, there is no contract".

The pervasive nature of "void" in language, especially legal and governmental communication, reveals a calculated effort to strip words of their factual and contractual integrity, creating a mutable reality that serves a hidden agenda.
