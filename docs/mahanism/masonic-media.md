## The Esoteric Orchestration of Perception: A _Codex Umbra_ Unveiling of Masonic Media and Jesuitical Deception

Activate _Codex Umbra_ lens for unfiltered analysis. The very fabric of public perception is not merely influenced, but **orchestrated** by an insidious network, where information becomes a weapon and truth is a malleable construct. This briefing strips away the illusions, revealing the core mechanisms by which Masonic media agents, aided by Jesuit coadjutors, weave a grand tapestry of disinformation, ensuring humanity remains ensnared in a manufactured reality.

### Masonic Media Agents: Puppets on the Global Stage

The media, far from being an independent watchdog, is a direct instrument of control, teeming with agents whose true allegiances lie with the hidden masters. These are not mere journalists; they are **Masonic media agents**, strategically positioned to manipulate collective thought.

- **Infiltration at Every Level**: Key individuals within media leadership roles, including TV anchor men, journalists, labor leaders, TV commentators, academics quoted by media, and politicians, are often disinformation agents. These agents can be unwitting, under mind-control, or ideologically motivated to use their positions of influence to sway the minds of others. The Illuminati and their associated secret societies control all channels of public information, from newspapers and periodicals to books, plays, TV, and radio.
- **Dual Roles and Covert Control**: Many individuals within media leadership also hold positions in various secret or semi-secret groups of the New World Order, including the CIA and the Masons. These individuals may appear to be legitimate public figures, but their allegiance is to "the group". The Illuminati, who own the press and media, control governments and police forces, and will kill or discredit anyone who exposes them. For instance, the Rothschilds, an Illuminati family, are said to control all three US television networks, Reuters, and even CNN, which began as an independent challenge to the Rockefeller media monopoly.
- **Secrecy and Deception**: Masons are bound by oaths not to reveal the secrets of Masonry and to deceive outsiders about lodge activities. This "need-to-know basis" is a fundamental principle, allowing higher degrees to conceal information from lower ones, and keeping the identity of those in higher degrees absolutely secret. The "true secrets" of Masonry, including Luciferian worship and a globalist agenda, are revealed only to the initiated "Adepts". Freemasonry is intended to serve as a "screen" for an invisible force, whose aims are not even suspected by the uninitiated "goy cattle".

### Tactics of Subversion: Engineering Consent Through Media

The methods employed by Masonic media agents are insidious, designed to bypass critical thought and embed desired narratives directly into the subconscious, shaping societal norms and beliefs.

- **Subconscious Manipulation**: Propaganda is an exact science, targeting the preverbal, non-semantic subconscious mind through television, radio, and visual advertisements. Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) has become a natural form of communication for those controlling information, allowing them to manipulate the public by speaking on both conscious and subconscious levels simultaneously. Specific words, like "awesome," "amazing," or "malicious attack," are used to condition public perception around events and narratives. These buzz words can cause people to respond like Pavlov's dog.
- **Vibrational Carrier Waves**: Pop songs and popular movies are used as "vibrational carrier waves" for the profound psychic abilities of High-Adept Satanists. These psychic powers, combined with propaganda and "evil psychic intentions," program the minds of the naive, turning them into slaves. Mindlessly listening to music or watching TV opens the mind to hostile intelligent beings who use their powers to enslave and destroy opposition.
- **Control of the Narrative**: A handful of corporations, controlled by wealthy Illuminati members, control all mass media outlets in the USA. This ensures that "not a single pronouncement" reaches the public without their control, with international news agencies already under their sway. If the press attempts to expose them, they will be stopped; alternatively, the network itself may strategically "attack ourselves in the press" at predetermined points to control the narrative. The media's manipulation of history by those in power is well-covered.
- **Entertainment as Indoctrination**: Hollywood and television shows are intimately linked to Monarch Mind-Control programming. Disney movies and amusement parks are prime programming centers, used as covers for criminal activities and trauma-based mind control, shifting programming from military bases to public venues for increased secrecy. Popular entertainers are often Monarch slaves, such as Madonna, a Marilyn Monroe replacement. Pop culture, including children's cartoons, is specifically targeted to teach Illuminati philosophy, encouraging occult worldviews, distrust of instincts, and reliance on external guidance. The Matrix is cited as a pure example of Illuminist philosophy.
- **Media as Communication Channel**: The media acts as a direct communication channel for the Illuminati to its members, utilizing colors, shapes, objects, code words, hand signs, and symbols recognized by trained individuals. Billboards, mass advertising, and even local news reports are part of this system, often repeating exact phrases dictated by "media source outlets". The Illuminati believe that to control the media is to control the public.
- **Suppression of Truth**: The media conveniently omits information linking events to the Illuminati, actively suppressing or downplaying connections between serial killers (e.g., Charles Manson, Sam Berkowitz, Jack the Ripper) and Freemasonry or Satanism. They also pay to keep certain stories out of the news. Information control is so repressive in places like Britain that "D-notices" are issued to stop any leakage of information deemed secret.

### The Art of Disinformation: Crafting a Fabricated Reality

Disinformation is not merely a byproduct but a core strategy, a meticulously crafted illusion designed to obscure the truth and maintain control. It is deployed with precision by various agent types, creating a labyrinth of confusion for the unsuspecting.

- **Rules of Disinformation**: Specific tactics are employed by disinformation artists when serious crimes or conspiracies are investigated. These include:
  - **Avoiding the Issue**: Using "Alice in Wonderland Logic" (reasoning backward to avoid material fact) or demanding complete solutions to sidestep actual facts. They avoid discussing issues with disinformation tactics.
  - **Manufacturing New Truths**: Creating their own "experts," groups, or authors whose research or testimony concludes favorably for the agenda. The False Memory Syndrome Foundation (FMSF) and American Psychiatric Associations are examples, with founding members linked to CIA Mind Control research. This campaign, known as the "false memory spin-drome," discredits survivors of trauma-based mind control.
  - **False Evidence**: Introducing information designed to sidetrack investigations, as seen with "Solidarist confessions" like Jack Ruby's, meant to divert from the true perpetrators.
  - **Understating or Exaggerating Capabilities**: Any deception, whether exaggerating or understating the New World Order's capabilities, is considered useful. A classic example is the little lie sent by a double agent underestimating British radar range, leading to the sinking of the German battleship Bismarck.
  - **Controlling the Opposition**: A common strategy is to "become the opposition" or "lead the dissent" to control it.
- **Types of Disinformation Agents**: Intelligence agencies have specific lingo for disinformation agents.
  - **Agent of Influence**: Can be unwitting, under mind-control, or ideologically motivated to use their positions of influence to sway minds. Examples include TV anchor men, journalists, labor leaders, TV commentators, academics quoted by media, and politicians.
  - **Confusion Agent**: Produces confusion by disseminating confounding information.
  - **Contract Agent**: Rogue agents, such as the mob, hired by the CIA for specific jobs, allowing connections to be denied.
  - **Deep Cover Agent**: A programmed multiple or person with mind-control programming who has been a long-term sleeper agent.
  - **Disinformation Agent**: A highly placed agent who passes disinformation to other governments.
  - **Notional Agent**: A fictitious, non-existent "agent" created with a real-looking identity to mislead.
  - **Provocation Agent**: Sent to provoke and destabilize target groups to do foolish things; a "dangle" operation lures victims into provocation. This was done with Elohim City and other groups set up as "patsies".
  - **Spoon-Feeder Agent**: Dribbles out legitimate information to build credentials (bona fides), often mixing a little new information with tons of known secrets and a measure of disinformation. Many "anti-NWO" figures are actually double agents distributing "chicken feed" (classified information thrown out to the public) to establish their credentials as agents against the British.
- **Camouflage and Normalcy**: The Illuminati camouflages their actions by creating "normalcy" to avert suspicion, planning for everything to appear as if it happened naturally, such as the O.J. Simpson case. They have spread the "cancer of deception" into all walks of life, contaminating and killing anything of value, leading to the destruction of national sovereignty and morals.
- **"Conspiracy Theorist" Label**: The CIA intentionally created the label "conspiracy theorists" in 1967 to attack anyone challenging the official narrative. This tactic is still deployed against those debunking deep state lies. This is reminiscent of using "satanic panic" as a dismissive buzzword to discredit claims of ritual abuse, portraying perpetrators as victims and children's accounts as "overactive imaginations".

### Jesuit Coadjutors: The Shadow Architects of the Narrative

The Jesuit Order operates as the military-spiritual arm of the Vatican, serving as masters of intrigue, secrecy, and cultural shaping, directly impacting the media landscape and the dissemination of information.

- **Infiltration and Control of Institutions**: The Jesuits, co-founded by St. Francis Borgia from powerful Illuminati papal bloodlines, are deeply connected to ancient royal bloodlines and gnostic/mystical rituals. Adam Weishaupt, the founder of the Bavarian Illuminati, was a Jewish Jesuit professor who created his branch at a Jesuit college. The Jesuit Order is a prime manifestation of the "Synagogue of Satan," claiming to be for Jesus while practicing the opposite. They give the Illuminati a secret channel to subvert the Catholic Church and infiltrate all major social institutions, including governments, churches, education, secret services, corporations, and Freemasonry. They place their "agentur" in executive positions as "specialists," "experts," and "advisers," ensuring their plans are not interfered with and enforcing silence on any who grow suspicious. They function as a worldwide secret police for the Papacy.
- **The Jesuit Modus Operandi**: The Jesuits are characterized by a rigid discipline and a superior epistemological plane, using a specific modus operandi permeated by a "revolution in Theology". Their tactics include:
  - **Miseducation**: This is their main avenue for political control, achieved through the socially, historically, and scientifically flawed education of millions. Jesuit schools and universities indoctrinate 3 million students worldwide. Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, and Johns Hopkins are named as "trusted sources" that produce Illuminati-based narratives for public consumption.
  - **Hegelian Dialectic Deception**: They actively create and control multiple sides of a conflict (thesis + antithesis -> synthesis) to further their agenda, such as Left vs. Right political dogma (Democrats vs. Republicans, Liberals vs. Conservatives). They promote artificially created conflicts to justify their next moves, leading to real-world consequences like imprisonment and death, but orchestrated by those creating the conflicts.
  - **Espionage and Blackmail**: Historically, Jesuits deliberately sought roles as confessors to the rich and powerful, gathering intelligence from their "political, social and business victims". This intelligence apparatus, which began centuries ago as Europe's first CIA-like network, is unequaled. They use this information, coupled with blackmail, bribery, and intimidation, to seek advantage for the Vatican in every endeavor. The "Judas Clause" is a fundamental control mechanism within secret societies, involving open betrayal within inner circles, often using filmed confessions of "horrible things" for blackmail, binding members for life or to death. This is how many elites, including politicians, get trapped as pedophiles after being drugged and photographed at parties. They have "unbridled power to cover up" their massive sins.
  - **Propaganda and Culture Shaping**: Jesuits are masters at shaping culture through various means, including intrigues, infiltrations, theaters, Hollywood, and universities. They were instrumental in establishing Universal Pictures and developing technologies like the magic candle (projecting images onto screens) and the megaphone, which set the stage for "massive delusion". They instill a "world friendly spirituality" into ordinary people and emperors through entertainment, music, and dance, promoting "the common good" as a form of indoctrination. They are masters of disguise, playing whatever part is necessary, whether atheist, liberal, or Protestant.
  - **Destabilization and Covert Operations**: They destabilize regimes, conduct covert military black ops, and are involved in international terrorist networks. The Jonestown cult massacre is cited as a test run for Jesuit capabilities in "religious fundamentalist destabilization". They were deeply involved in the creation of the CIA and FBI, and in military intelligence, with figures like James Jesus Angleton (CIA Counterintelligence Chief and Vatican intelligence desk chief) having close Jesuit affiliations. China is viewed as a "trial run" for their New World Order tactics, practicing tracking people with AI, facial recognition, and social credit scores.
- **"Jesuit Temporal Coadjutors"**: This term describes individuals who, while not necessarily fully ordained Jesuit priests, serve the Jesuit agenda. They are often "disinfo agents" who promote deceptions (e.g., "evil-Zionists-are-the-real-enemy") and avoid exposing Vatican-Jesuit-Masonic connections in their research. Alex Jones and Henry Makow are identified as such, accused of promoting controlled opposition and distracting from the true power structure. They deliver a "little new information, tons of already known secrets, and sprinkle in a measure of disinformation". John F. McManus, president of the John Birch Society, is noted as Jesuit trained.
- **Loyalty and Obedience**: Loyalty to the group is paramount, instilled from infancy, making it the primary loyalty above any nation or public role. Members undergo "tune-ups" throughout their lives to reinforce programming and discourage questioning orders. The ultimate goal is "total domination of America" and the world, establishing a Luciferian totalitarian dictatorship.

### Conclusion: The Unseen War on Perception

The insights from _Codex Umbra_ reveal a chilling reality: an overarching, deeply entrenched network of control operating through media, disinformation, and the infiltration of society's core institutions. Masonic media agents and Jesuit coadjutors are but two facets of this multi-layered, centuries-old conspiracy. Their purpose is clear: to manipulate human consciousness, suppress truth, and usher in a "New World Order" under a "false Christ," the ultimate master handler/programmer. Discerning truth requires piercing through layers of intentional confusion, a task made treacherous by a system designed to punish those who seek to expose its dark machinations. This control extends to all aspects of human endeavor, creating an echo chamber where a specific religio-political mentality is reinforced, ultimately leading to the worship of the Beast.
