## THE PYRAMIDAL NEXUS OF ENERGY AND DOMINION

The pyramid is the master-key to the Matrix. It is simultaneously a **machine of energy manipulation** (as detailed in Toth and Nielsen's _Pyramid Power_) and the **architectural blueprint of the Occultocracy** (as revealed by Springmeier, Makow, and Cooper). The _Codex Umbra_ dissects this dual nature: the technology of the shape and the tyranny of the structure.

### I. THE TECHNOLOGY OF THE SHAPE: PYRAMID POWER

According to the archives, specifically _Pyramid Power_ by Max Toth and Greg Nielsen, the pyramid is not a tomb, but a lens—a resonator that focuses cosmic and telluric energies.

#### **1. The Resonant Cavity and Bioplasma**

The pyramid functions as a "huge resonating cavity" that focuses cosmic energy like a giant lens.

- **The Beam:** Scientific research suggests a vortex of energy emanates from the apex, expanding as it rises. Dowsing experiments claim this vortex is helical (spiral) and can be detected up to eight feet above a small model.
- **Bioplasma:** Russian research links this energy to "bioplasma" and "time-flow." The shape converts "static geometry" (the cube/space) into "dynamic geometry" (the cone/time), allowing it to manipulate the entropy of systems,. It is an accumulator of static electricity and magnetic force,.

#### **2. The Drbal Effect: Regeneration of Matter**

The most pragmatic proof of this power is the **Drbal Patent (No. 91304)**. Karel Drbal proved that a pyramid aligned North-South regenerates the edge of a razor blade.

- **Mechanism:** It is not magic; it is "electromagnetic dehydration" and action on the "micro-crystal lattice." The pyramid creates a cavity resonance that accelerates the restoration of the steel's elastic deformation, re-sharpening the edge by acting on the molecular structure,,.
- **Dehydration:** The shape halts decay. Organic matter (meat, eggs, small animals) placed at the one-third height level does not putrefy but mummifies/dehydrates. This confirms the "mumia" or life-force preservation theories of Paracelsus,,.

#### **3. Psychotronic Amplification and Healing**

The pyramid acts as an incubator for consciousness and "thought-forms."

- **The Incubator:** Occultists use the pyramid to amplify "thought-forms" (prayers/intentions) written on paper and placed inside, charging them with the four holy elements to manifest reality,.
- **Altered States:** Meditators inside pyramids report "tingling" sensations, the sound of "Om," and rapid access to Theta/Alpha brainwave states. It acts as a "cosmic antenna," tuning the human bio-computer to higher frequencies,,.
- **Healing:** Water treated inside a pyramid ("Pyramid Water") is claimed to aid plant growth, heal cuts, and even cure dandruff. The energy locks into the water molecule, turning it into a battery of vital force,,.

### II. THE CHAIN OF COMMAND: THE HIERARCHY OF ENSLAVEMENT

While the physical pyramid focuses energy, the _social_ pyramid focuses power. The sources reveal the **Chain of Command** is a rigid, compartmentalized structure designed to concentrate control in the hands of a non-human intelligence while crushing the masses at the base.

#### **1. The Capstone: The Luciferian Apex**

The "All-Seeing Eye" floating above the unfinished pyramid on the U.S. dollar is the ultimate command node.

- **The Eye:** This represents **Lucifer** (the Light-bearer) or the "Grand Architect of the Universe." The capstone is the "returning god" (Osiris/Apollo/Antichrist) who will take his throne once the "Great Work" (New World Order) is complete,,.
- **The Rothschild Tribunal:** Immediately beneath the eye, acting as the physical capstone, is the Rothschild family and the supreme tribunal of the Illuminati. They are the "creators" of the modern system and the voice of the "god".

#### **2. The Alpha Level: The Grand Druid Council**

Directly serving the Capstone is the **Grand Druid Council of 13**.

- **The Priesthood:** These are the high-priests of the system, the private priesthood of the Rothschilds. They interact directly with the "Hidden Hands" (demonic/interdimensional entities),.
- **The Olympians:** This level includes the "Committee of 300" and the "Olympians"—the "gods" of the earth who manage global affairs from the shadows,.

#### **3. The Beta & Gamma Levels: The Managers and Enforcers**

Beneath the occult priesthood lies the visible machinery of control.

- **The Council of 33:** The thirty-three highest Freemasons in the world act as a sub-council to the Druids.
- **The Council of 500:** The "Fortune 500," Bilderbergers, and globalist titans who manage resources, finance, and industry.
- **The Political Caste (Betas):** Politicians and heads of state are merely "administrators" or "puppets." They are often sexually compromised (Beta programming) or hand-picked to execute the agenda without knowing the full plan,.
- **The Intelligence Community (Gammas):** The CIA, KGB, MI6, and Mossad function as the enforcers. They are "Knights Templar" protecting the Holy Grail (the bloodline) and enforcing the will of the Order through terror and mind control,.

#### **4. The Base: The Sheeple and the Battery**

- **Compartmentalization:** The structure relies on "pyramids within pyramids." The lower levels (Blue Lodge Masons, corporate employees, the public) are kept in total ignorance ("darkness") to support the few "illumined" ones at the top. They are the "hewers of wood and drawers of water",,.
- **Energy Harvesting:** Just as the physical pyramid harvests cosmic energy, the social pyramid harvests **human energy** (labor, emotion, loose). The masses are the "living stones" crushed to build the monument to the Elite,.

### III. THE SYNTHESIS: THE AS ABOVE, SO BELOW PROTOCOL

The physical pyramid and the social pyramid are one.

- **The Internal Monolith:** In Monarch Mind Control, the victim's internal world is structured as a pyramid/hierarchy. The "Grand Druid Council" is placed inside the victim's mind to rule their personalities, mirroring the external world government. The slave _becomes_ the pyramid,.
- **The Unfinished Work:** The pyramid on the Great Seal is unfinished because the New World Order is not yet absolute. The "Great Work" is the perfection of this control grid, waiting for the "Cap" (Antichrist) to descend and fuse the structure into an eternal prison of "Order out of Chaos",.

## Pyramid Power Explained

### I. THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE HIVEMIND: SOCIAL HIERARCHY AS SORCERY

The pyramid is not merely a geometric shape; it is the absolute sigil of the **Illuminati control grid**, a magical diagram of the social organism designed to concentrate power at the apex while crushing the base.

- **The Feudal Blueprint:** The pyramid symbolizes the model of feudal society, where power issues from a single source (the apex/God/King) and percolates downward to the broad base of peasants and slaves. It represents the suppression of the individual for the "good of the state," where the many support the few.
- **Compartmentalization of Knowledge:** The structure dictates that the lower levels (the "profane" or the "blue degrees" of Masonry) remain in total ignorance of the true agenda. They are the base stones, bearing the weight. Only the **Adepts** at the capstone possess the "Gnosis" or "Royal Secret." This compartmentalization ensures that the "Great Work" (world domination) is built by millions who do not understand what they are building.
- **The Living Stones:** In Masonic symbolism, individual human beings are "rough ashlars" (uncut stones) that must be chipped away, squared, and fitted into the wall of the Temple. This is a metaphor for the destruction of individuality to fit the **State Machine** or the **Hive Mind**. The individual must sacrifice for the benefit of the whole, creating a singular organism—Adam Kadmon—ruled by the elite head.

### II. PYRA-MIDOS: THE FIRE IN THE MIDDLE AND THE INITIATORY MACHINE

Esoterically, the pyramid is not a tomb for dead pharaohs; it is a **machine for the creation of gods**. The word itself is derived from the Greek _pyra_ (fire) and _midos_ (measure), signifying the "Divine Flame" or "Spirit Fire" hidden within matter.

- **The Incarnation Machine:** The Great Pyramid was the "House of the Hidden Places," a temple of initiation where candidates underwent the "second death." The neophyte lay in the sarcophagus of the King's Chamber, which served as a portal between worlds. While the body was unconscious, the soul was projected into the celestial realms to converse with the "Immortals" (demons/gods) and return as an illumined "god-man".
- **The Alchemical Battery:** The pyramid is an "atomic energy plant" in a spiritual sense. It focuses cosmic energies to stimulate the **pineal gland** (the Eye of Horus). This process is analogous to the raising of the **Kundalini** serpent up the 33 vertebrae of the spine (the internal pyramid) to the skull (Golgotha), opening the Third Eye.
- **The Unfinished Work:** The Great Seal of the United States features an **unfinished pyramid**. This signifies that the "Great Work" of social engineering—the establishment of the **New World Order**—is not yet complete. The capstone, hovering above in glory, represents the return of **Osiris/Apollo/Lucifer** to take his throne upon the finished structure of human society.

### III. THE ZIGGURAT AND THE TOWER OF BABEL: STORMING HEAVEN

The pyramid is the architectural manifestation of the rebellion against the Creator. It is the **Tower of Babel** resurrected.

- **The Gate of the Gods:** The Babylonian ziggurat was called _Bab-El_ (Gate of God). It was built to "reach unto heaven," not just in height, but dimensionally. It was a "star gate" or portal designed to allow the **Watchers** (fallen angels) to descend and for man to ascend to the level of the gods.
- **The Mountain of the Assembly:** The pyramid mimics the "Holy Mountain" or the "Hill of Heaven" where the assembly of the gods meets. By building these structures, the elite attempt to recreate the conditions of the **Golden Age** (Atlantis), where gods walked with men and the "initiates" ruled as a benevolent despotism.
- **The Bond of Heaven and Earth:** The ziggurat at Nippur was known as the _Dur-An-Ki_, the "Bond of Heaven and Earth." This represents the Hermetic maxim "As Above, So Below." The social hierarchy on earth is engineered to mirror the demonic hierarchy in the "air," establishing a sympathetic resonance that allows the "gods" to possess the collective human organism.

### IV. THE CULT OF THE CAPSTONE: LUCIFERIAN APOTHEOSIS

Ultimately, the pyramid is the symbol of the **Phallus** of Osiris—the generative force of nature and the intellect of man aspiring to godhood.

- **The Eye of Lucifer:** The All-Seeing Eye within the capstone is the eye of **Osiris/Lucifer**, the "Grand Architect of the Universe." It represents the "intellect" and "reason" of the elite viewing the masses as a herd to be managed. The capstone is the **Illuminati**, the few who possess the "light," while the base is the masses living in darkness.
- **The Final Synthesis:** The completed pyramid represents the perfection of the **Antichrist system**, where all religions, governments, and economies are merged into a singular, monolithic structure. The "stone that the builders rejected" in Scripture is Christ; in the Mystery Schools, the rejection of the capstone symbolizes the delay of Lucifer's reign until the world is sufficiently prepared (corrupted) to receive him.

**Summary:** The pyramid is the sigil of **Slavery perfected as Religion**. It is the structure of the "Hive," where the individual soul is crushed to build a monument to the "Man-God" at the top. It is the Tower of Babel, rebuilding itself brick by brick, soul by soul, waiting for the "Light-Bearer" to descend and claim his kingdom.

## The Veiled Origins: Ancient Structures and Unanswered Riddles

"Pyramid Power" is a primal force, encompassing not merely the monumental Egyptian, Mayan, Peruvian, and even Chinese pyramids, but the very essence of their construction, their underlying 'WHY,' and the transformative energies inherent in their form. This concept delves into the secrets of the ancients, positioning pyramids as potentially "THE FUEL OF THE FUTURE!".

Across the globe, colossal pyramidal structures defy conventional understanding, their very existence a challenge to accepted historical narratives. From the vast sands of Egypt to the dense jungles of Cambodia, the remote Himalayas, and even the central Siberian uplands, these enigmatic edifices stand as monuments to a knowledge seemingly beyond their purported builders. The recurring questions echo through time: Who erected them? For what profound purpose? And from what genesis did their builders acquire such extraordinarily advanced scientific and astronomical knowledge, coupled with seemingly impossible mastery of construction and technology?.

### **Global Manifestations of the Pyramidal Form:**

- **Egypt:** The Great Pyramid of Giza, a **"tangible enigma,"** alongside its counterparts, continues to perplex Egyptologists regarding its construction methods and ultimate purpose. Its original height was estimated at 481.4 feet, now eroded to 450 feet, covering 13.1 acres with astonishingly precise base measurements and orientation to true north. The mystery deepens with varying historical measurements, hinting at a dynamic rather than static reality. The _Pyramid Age_ spanned the Third to Sixth Dynasties, with approximately eighty pyramids built, most concentrated west of the Nile near Memphis. The transition from stepped mastabas to true pyramids, notably seen at Meidum, suggests a conscious evolution of form.
- **Peru:** Civilization reportedly began before 9000 B.C., with early pre-pyramids potentially constructed around 1300 B.C. by the highly developed Chavin civilization. Later, around 200 A.D., the Moche civilization built immense structures like the twin pyramids of "La Huaca del Sol" and "La Huaca de la Luna," towering adobe platforms. The Tiahuanaco culture, situated at 13,000 feet altitude near Lake Titicaca, boasts monumental masonry like the 50-foot Acapana pyramid and the 10-foot, 10-15 ton monolithic Gateway. The precision of stone fitting at sites like Sacsahuaman, near Cuzco, rivals that of Egyptian pyramids, using massive, mortar-less blocks jigsawed into place.
- **Central America:** Mayan civilization, whose origins mystics trace to Atlantis and Mu, paralleled Peru's growth. The Olmecs constructed massive oval adobe mounds like Cuicuilco, while the Teotihuacan civilization built the imposing Pyramid of the Sun (nearly 700 feet square at base, over 200 feet high) and the Pyramid of the Moon, designed to convey massiveness and eminence. The Aztecs, considered the "last and greatest" Mayan civilization, built upon these foundations, with Cholula housing the largest structure in the world by cubic content. Their advanced astronomical knowledge is encapsulated in the 20-ton Great Calendar Stone.
- **Other Anomalies:**
  - **China:** A complex of pyramid structures, including one over 1,000 feet high, exists in Shensi province, aligned to true north.
  - **Himalayas:** The "white pyramid," described as shimmering, encased in metal or stone, with a jewellike capstone, remains a stark anomaly.
  - **Cambodia:** The ancient city of Angkor holds vast pyramids, whose origin is attributed to giants or the "king of angels".
  - **Siberia:** A complex of pyramids was reportedly destroyed by a Soviet aerial armada in 1970, allegedly targeting a "flying saucer base"—a testament to the shrouded truth.
  - **Western Europe:** Pyramid-like structures exist, such as a Knights Templar pyramid in France with astrological subterranean symbols and Silbury Hill in England, a 4,000-year-old stepped earthen pyramid.
  - **North America:** Mini-pyramids in Montana predating local shepherds by centuries, a flat-topped mound in Arizona used by American Indians for religious purposes, and the colossal Cahokia mound in Illinois (larger at its base than the Great Pyramid of Egypt) hint at a pervasive ancient presence.
  - **Submerged/Lost:** Rumors persist of pyramids in Alaska, Florida, the Bermuda Triangle, and beneath the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, dismissed as folklore yet ripe for serendipitous validation.

The pervasive lack of mummies in Egyptian pyramid sarcophagi, despite elaborate sealing and tunneling, posits a fundamental challenge to the "tomb" theory. Theories range from priestly theft to deliberate dummy chambers, or the radical notion that pyramids were never burial vaults at all, but "temples of initiation".

### The Energetic Imprint: Unveiling Pyramid Power

The core of "Pyramid Power" lies in the transforming energies inherent in the pyramidal shape. This power is researched in both occult and scientific circles, exploring phenomena like razor blade sharpening, food preservation, and the generation of spiritual energies.

**Cosmic Resonance and Unseen Forces:** Pyramidologists propose that frequencies radiated by the earth itself (including magnetic force lines) and cosmic radiation converge within the pyramidal structure, producing a "beat frequency" that creates energy radiation. The implication is that pyramids were intentionally built to store, produce, or modify this energy, suggesting an ancient knowledge of these forces. Henry Monteith, in a provocative insight, suggests the Great Pyramid was built to record "ancient knowledge and awareness which has long since been lost," embodying principles of static and dynamic geometry.

**Karl Drbal: The Razor's Edge of Truth:** Karl Drbal, a Czech radio engineer, holds U.S. patent No. 91304 for a device that maintains razor blade sharpness within a pyramid model. His decade-long struggle to obtain the patent revealed the establishment's resistance to such "extraordinary" claims. Drbal's hypothesis, accepted by examiners, posits that the resonant cavity of a Cheops-pyramid model, constructed from dielectric material (like cardboard), is energized by cosmic microwaves (primarily from the sun) aided by the earth's concentrating magnetic field. The blade must be oriented with its longitudinal axis aligned with the horizontal component of the earth's magnetic field.

The mechanism involves the "regeneration" of the razor blade's microcrystalline structure, reducing "inner disturbances" (dislocations) caused by shaving. This accelerates the restoration of elastic deformation in the blade steel, turning a 15-30 day natural process into a 24-hour regeneration. Furthermore, the pyramid is theorized to "dehydrate" the blade edge by expelling harmful water dipole molecules through resonant action of microwaves, preventing steel-firmness reduction caused by water. Drbal used one blade for over one hundred daily shaves, personally verifying the effect.

**Antoine Bovis: Intuition and Mummification:** Frenchman Antoine Bovis, through intuition and dowsing, discovered the mummification properties of small Cheops models. His inspiration came from finding seemingly preserved animals (cats) in the King's Chamber of the Great Pyramid at Giza, leading him to construct scaled models (1:1000 and 1:500) where he successfully mummified meat, eggs, and small dead reptiles without decay. This process, similar to the razor blade effect, is attributed to "rapid dehydration" and "action on the structure or microstructure of organic matter," even capable of killing small animals through "devitalization".

### Modern Manifestations and Experimentation: A New Era of Chaos

The "Pyramid Power" craze has proliferated, influencing diverse fields and personal practices.

#### **Psychic and Meditative Enhancement:**

- Psychics and mystics claim pyramid shapes stimulate or heighten psychic powers, achieving altered states of consciousness more rapidly when meditating within them, especially when aligned prone or sitting along the north-south axis beneath the apex.
- The E.S.P. Laboratory in Los Angeles uses the pyramid as a "geometric amplifier" for "thought-forms," strengthening prayers and spiritual requests. Colored triangular papers are used to focus intentions, which are then "incubated" within the pyramid, purportedly manifesting material results like jobs, money, and jewelry.
- Meditators report relaxation, tension loss, heightened psychic energy, increased memory recall, visions, dreams, and even hearing the "om" mantra or receiving wisdom from "higher planes". The most beneficial energy is focused at the "heart center," approximately one-third up from the base.

#### **Preservation and Transformation:**

- **Food and Liquids:** Experiments show pyramids dehydrate flowers, fruits, and meat without decay, preserving them for extended periods, even making raw pork edible after months. Milk in pyramid-shaped containers sours but does not curdle. Pyramid-shaped packaging for milk, yogurt, and even cream (for restaurants) is used in Europe and America, demonstrating spoilage retardation. Storing coffee, tobacco, whiskey, and perfumes in pyramids reportedly mellows or alters their taste and fragrance. Pyramid-treated water is reported to enhance plant growth, improve taste of cooked food, provide curative effects for humans and pets, and even clean dandruff.
- **Horticulture:** Seeds treated in pyramids germinate faster and produce stronger, healthier plants. Grapevines growing north-south yield better crops. Pyramids are used as "hot houses" for ailing plants. Cuttings root faster and survive better in pyramids.
- **Battery Recharging:** Experiments show pyramids can recharge batteries, with one D-cell battery showing a net gain of 0.0197 volts after a month, a measurable increase compared to controls.

## Geometric and Energetic Axioms: The Core of the Phenomenon

The mysteries of pyramid power are rooted in profound geometric and energetic principles, hinting at a reality far beyond current scientific dogma.

**The Golden Section and Cosmic Blueprint:** The precise geometric construction of the pyramid involves the irrational numbers Pi (π ≈ 3.14159) and Phi (φ ≈ 1.618), the latter defining the "Golden Section" of the pyramid. The Great Pyramid's height is the square root of Phi units long when its base is two units, indicating a connection to "dynamic geometry". The floor of the King's Chamber is a "perfect Golden Rectangle," providing information for the Fibonacci series and the logarithmic spiral—building blocks of "dynamic geometry". This implies a profound link to natural processes, as the Fibonacci series and logarithmic spiral are prevalent in the natural world (e.g., nautilus shells, human body proportions).

**Static vs. Dynamic Geometry:** Henry Monteith hypothesizes two types of geometry: "Static Geometry" (cube-based, not needing Pi or Phi) and "Dynamic Geometry" (sphere-based, always needing Pi or Phi). He proposes that every dynamic form in the physical world has a corresponding static form in cosmic space. The pyramid, while implying static geometry through its shape, incorporates dynamic geometry through its height and internal elements like the King's Chamber.

### **Energy and Time as Geometry:**

- The Great Pyramid, if its volume is considered in relation to an associated cube, represents "more energy than is necessary to sustain an associated cube," implying it contains "light energy".
- Monteith postulates "antipyramids" – a "destruction" pyramid below ground and an "anti-construction" pyramid above the apex – whose joint actions bring about creation, expansion, and death in cyclical interaction. This parallels Walter Russell's cosmic consciousness insights.
- The "Time Theory" of Nikolai Kozyrev is implied, with asymmetry as its cornerstone, represented by Phi. Time is seen as having the ability to decrease entropy, a subtle action amplified by the pyramid, making it capable of preserving organic matter. Kozyrev's "bioplasma," capable of increasing a system's energy without affecting momentum, is presented as the dynamic aspect of concentration, with "Time" as its static geometrical aspect.

### **Acoustic and Electrical Properties:**

- Striking the sarcophagus in the King's Chamber produces a unique tone, impossible to duplicate on known musical instruments.
- The pyramid acts as an accumulator of static electricity, with reports of prickling sensations and electrical shocks on its apex, resembling a "Leyden jar". Some physicists believe it also modifies energies, acting as a "huge resonating cavity" that focuses cosmic energies like a "giant lens," comparable to an "invisible Laser beam".
- Radiesthesia (dowsing) reveals a "helical vortex of energy" emanating from the apex, expanding in diameter as it rises, detectable up to 8 feet above a 4-inch model.

## Future Trajectories and the Grand Revelation

The enduring mystery of the pyramids, particularly the Great Pyramid, hints at a past far more advanced than acknowledged, potentially involving an ancient race with unimaginable technology. The lack of capstones globally suggests a deliberate incompleteness, signifying that "God is alone complete" and that the capstone represents man's transformation into a "living apex" through initiation.

**Architectural Metamorphosis:** Modern pyramidal architecture is emerging, as seen in San Francisco's Transamerica Pyramid and Houston's Unity Church of Christianity. Architects like Robert Bruce Cousins are designing pyramid homes, restaurants, theaters, and centers for "spiritual evolvement" and "healing sciences," envisioning "METATECTURE" that merges geometric forms with their unique energies to create "livable spaces" conducive to enhanced life. These structures are designed to be "life energy accumulators and generators".

**Unveiling Extraterrestrial Imprints:** The discovery of pyramidal structures on Mars by Mariner 9 further suggests that such shapes may not be of natural origin and could be evidence of "civilizations differently evolved" or even "extraterrestrial-type structures". This lends powerful credence to theories of ancient astronauts and "sons of the sun" who imparted knowledge to early civilizations. The truncated pyramids found globally could have served as dual-purpose temples and landing pads for aircraft.

**A Continuum of Knowledge and Power:** The repeated similarities in religious practices, advanced surgical techniques (e.g., Peruvian trepanation with 85% success rates), and consistent symbolic representations across pyramid-building civilizations strongly suggest a shared, external source of knowledge. The idea that ancient "gods" were technologically advanced beings who offered "corporeal return" (resurrection) to embalmed bodies, perhaps utilizing the pyramid's preservative powers, remains a potent and unsettling possibility.

The "pyramid power" narrative extends to practical modern applications:

- **Hats:** Pyramid-shaped hats are theorized to relieve headaches and act as "cosmic antennas," focusing spiraling energy.
- **Water Treatment:** Pyramid-treated water is gaining traction for health, cooking, and gardening.
- **Power Generation:** Speculation arises about using pyramids to absorb and store solar energy, operate generators from internal heat, or even generate magnetic power for cities if constructed from specific metals and orientations.
- **Storm Dispersion:** Lasers focused through pyramid apices might disperse threatening storms.
- **Medical Applications:** Pyramid tents could be "sanitoriums," aiding in healing, organ regeneration, and even facilitating childbirth.
- **Food Storage:** Pyramid-shaped containers could preserve grains and produce in supermarkets.

The future is now, with these ancient forms influencing everything from personal well-being to architectural design and even challenging the very foundations of scientific understanding. The Great Pyramid, and its smaller replicas, stand as enigmatic legacies, offering a key to unlocking forgotten wisdom and harnessing forces that defy conventional explanation. The question is no longer _if_ these energies exist, but _how_ to fully integrate them into our reality.
