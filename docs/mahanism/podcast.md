## Shout Out / Thank You from Thomas Wolfe {#thank-you}

::::warning

The Masters Mahan Podcast was created by Thomas Wolfe in the original Audio-Only format. I (Urban) discovered the show when it was little known on Spotify and was moved by it and decided to share it. Thomas Wolfe noticed this and gave me authorization to upload the rest and also is aware of and allows me to remaster the episodes.

<span class="text-2xl font-bold text-red-600">Neither I (Urban) or Thomas Wolfe make money or income from this series. YouTube is known to place ads on episodes due to song copyright infringement.</span>

== Notes

> The Devil has a real kingdom. It exists on the Spiritual plane but it is as real for those who inhabit it as is the physical world that you and I live in here and now. It is nothing like modern religions portray it.
>
> Demons are nothing more than fallen angels, as such, they too were made in the image of God and look like we do, but they are liars just like their master-demon Lucifer is a liar, and so they prefer to appear in disguise.
>
> Their favorite disguises resemble something “beastly” because they know, when they look in the mirror that they are looking back at the face of God.
>
> Since all of us have to interact with demons from time to time, it is useful to understand how they try and destroy us. Let's step into the darkness together and explore this topic... you will be glad to stop being ignorant.
>
> If you want to "watch" this episode as a video-podcast, our "brother-in-arms" Urban has done that for you. Here's the link: https://rumble.com/v6mf3ml-demons-101-a-primer.html?e9s=src_v1_upp
