## **Reading List**

This reading list was provided in the book _The Illuminati Formula_ by Fritz Springmeier

Within the Illuminati, ranks are achieved with much learning and ritual. Within the Temple of Set, a member is required to read certain books. Fritz, the co-author has a list of books a Temple of Set member is asked to read, with the comments attached by the Temple of Set to each suggested title.

### **_Metropolis_** by Thea Von Harbou

In their suggested/required reading Category 19 entitled "The Metamind" is Metropolis by Thea von Harbou. Their comments are "An Expressionistic portrait of a negative utopia in which humans are controlled by machines.. .the basis for many electronic/audio-visual ritual techniques employed by the Church of Satan and further developed by the Temple of Set." (p. C21-2)

#### **Overview**

This source is excerpts from Thea von Harbou's novel *Metropolis*, which tells the story of **Freder**, the privileged son of the city's master, and his journey of discovery and transformation. Initially residing in the opulent "Club of the Sons," Freder is introduced to the grim reality of the underground city and the suffering **"Hands"** who operate the machines that power Metropolis, through a young woman named **Maria**. The narrative highlights the stark contrast between the wealthy elite living above ground and the laborers below, exploring themes of social inequality, industrialization, and the potential dangers of unchecked technological advancement. Ultimately, the story culminates in chaos and destruction caused by the workers' rebellion, led by a robotic **"Maria"** created by the inventor **Rotwang**, leading to a potential for reconciliation and a new beginning symbolized by the human Maria and Freder.

### **_Physical Control of the Mind: Towards a Psychocivilized Society_** by Jose M.R. Delgado

Another is Physical Control of the Mind: Towards a Psychocivilized Society by Jose M.R. Delgado. Their comments, "Delgado, Professor of Physiology at Yale University, is one of the most distinguished authorities in the field of Electrical/chemical Stimulation of the Brain (ESB). This book is necessarily dated, but it is so well-written that it deserves to be perused as a preface to more recent works on the subject." (p.C-16?-2)

#### **Overview**

This book, "Physical Control of the Mind: Toward a Psychocivilized Society" by Jose M. Delgado, explores the groundbreaking concept that the brain, the seat of our mental functions and behaviors, can be directly influenced and controlled by physical means, specifically **electrical stimulation of the brain (ESB)**. The text details numerous experiments, primarily on animals and occasionally on humans with implanted electrodes, demonstrating that a wide range of actions and even emotional states, from simple limb movements and complex behavioral sequences to fear, pleasure, and aggression, can be reliably triggered or inhibited by artificial electrical signals. While highlighting the profound implications of this newfound ability to bypass traditional sensory inputs and directly manipulate neural activity, Delgado also discusses the ethical considerations and potential limitations of such control, suggesting that behavior under ESB is still heavily shaped by an individual's existing neural architecture and learned experiences.

### _The Psychology of Anomalous Experience_ by Graham Reed

The Psychology of Anomalous Experience by Graham Reed. Their comments, "This book addresses unusual, irregular, and puzzling experiences- dejà vu, illusions, delusions, hallucinations, etc.-in terms of the mind’s normal psychological processes of gathering, monitoring, processing, and storing information." (ibid.)

One more book on the Temple of Set’s reading list would be worthy to point out, The Psychology of Man’s Possible Evolution by Peter D. Ouspensky.

#### **Overview**

This excerpt from Graham Reed's *The Psychology of Anomalous Experience* explores various unusual cognitive experiences, viewing them not as strictly pathological but as variations of normal psychological functioning. The author emphasizes a **cognitive approach**, focusing on processes like attention, perception, imagery, and memory, rather than solely on clinical diagnoses. The text delves into phenomena such as absent-mindedness, "time-gap" experiences, illusions, and different types of amnesia and hallucinations, explaining how disruptions or unusual applications of typical mental processes can lead to these **anomalous experiences**. Key themes include the impact of stress and diminished sensory input, individual differences in cognitive styles, and how cultural context shapes the interpretation and classification of these experiences.

### _Psychology of Man’s Possible Evolution_ by Peter D. Ouspensky

Their comments, "Should be read especially by those members whose magical ability is hampered by flaws in their balance factor....A series of lectures which explain the Gurdjieff approach to the concept better than G. himself was able to do." There is an important link between Gurdjieff, mind-control, MPD, etc. but the subject is big and needs to be further investigated. Co-author Fritz has been investigating this link, including talking with leaders of the most successful Gurdjieff commune. As with so many groups, what you see, is not what you get

#### **Overview**

This collection of excerpts explores a system of psychological thought, asserting that **traditional psychology is fundamentally flawed and has lost touch with its ancient roots**. The central premise is that **humanity is not a finished product but a machine operating mechanically in a state of "waking sleep," lacking true consciousness, unity, and will**. The path to **"man's possible evolution"** involves **rigorous self-study**, beginning with recognizing one's own mechanicalness, **overcoming ingrained habits like lying, imagination, and identification**, and requires the guidance and structure of a **school** that provides **new knowledge and methods** beyond ordinary understanding. This evolution involves developing **consciousness and being** in parallel, ultimately leading to a state of genuine **self-knowledge and understanding**, which differs significantly from mere intellectual knowing and requires effort and discipline on **three simultaneous lines of work**.

## _What are the common themes in all of the sources provided?_

Here is a comprehensive response drawing on the provided sources and our conversation history to address the common themes found across all the texts:

Across all the provided sources – Jose M. R. Delgado's "Physical Control of the Mind," P.D. Ouspensky's "The Psychology of Man's Possible Evolution," Graham Reed's "The Psychology of Anomalous Experience," and Thea Von Harbou's "Metropolis" – several interconnected themes emerge regarding human nature, consciousness, control, and the pursuit of knowledge and understanding. While they approach these themes from different perspectives – scientific investigation, philosophical psychology, clinical psychology, and fictional narrative – the underlying concerns resonate throughout the texts.

### **1. Human Nature and its Limitations**

A fundamental theme explored by all sources is the inherent nature and limitations of human beings. Delgado's work, rooted in neuroscience, posits that mental activities are dependent on basic mechanisms in the brain, and personality, though seemingly unique, is an "intra-cerebral elaboration of extra-cerebral information". Human behavior is the result of motor activities directed by complex cerebral command, and reactions are shaped by environmental stimuli interpreted by the brain. He notes that while humans have achieved ecological liberation, they have also created a "new kind of servitude dominated by levers, engines, currency, and computers". Despite advancements, decision-making still relies on little-known intra-cerebral mechanisms, and personality, rooted in nervous tissue, is influenced by environmental and historical factors.

Ouspensky, from a philosophical psychology standpoint, argues that man, as he currently exists, is largely a "machine" living in a state of "waking sleep". He contends that man _thinks_ he possesses powers like consciousness, unity, and will, but in reality does not. Man is born with an "essence" but develops a "personality" which is often a bad imitation of something else. This "mechanicalness" includes manifestations like lying and artificial "negative emotions" that are not useful but supported by justification and self-indulgence. Man is categorized into different types (Man No. 1-7) based on his level of "being," suggesting a spectrum of human realization beyond the ordinary state.

Reed, using a cognitive psychology lens, examines the limitations of normal human experience by studying "anomalous" or unusual subjective phenomena. He shows how attention, perception, memory, self-experience, and judgment are subject to distortions, failures, and disorders. These anomalies, ranging from absent-mindedness to delusions, reveal the complex and often imperfect nature of human cognitive processing. For instance, the perception of reality is subjective and interpretive, and memory is a reconstructive process based on "schemata" rather than a perfect recording. Different individuals vary in their cognitive styles and responses to stress, and societies impose cultural norms that determine what is considered "normal" or "pathological".

Von Harbou's fictional narrative, "Metropolis," vividly portrays a dehumanized future where workers are reduced to mere "numbers", their identities blurred. They are depicted as "used up" and "hollowed out" by the god-like machines they serve. The human material is considered "deficient" compared to the machines. Driven by despair and suffering, the workers succumb to madness and a lust for revenge. The story highlights how social and technological systems can strip away individuality and reduce humans to mechanical, expendable parts of a larger machine, yet also shows moments of love, sacrifice, and the yearning for connection and reconciliation.

All four sources, through their respective approaches, underscore that human nature is complex and multifaceted, subject to both internal constraints (brain function, mechanicalness, cognitive limitations) and external pressures (environment, technology, social structures, stress). They suggest that the common understanding of what it means to be human might be incomplete or flawed, highlighting inherent limitations and the potential for states beyond the perceived "normal."

### **2. Consciousness and the Perception of Reality/Experience**

The nature of consciousness, awareness, and how humans perceive and interpret reality is a central theme that connects all texts. Delgado's work explores the material basis of consciousness, suggesting it might be tied to specific brain mechanisms, and demonstrating how ESB can influence perception, evoke subjective experiences like hallucinations, recollections, and illusions, and alter the interpretation of the environment. He stresses the essential role of sensory input for mental activity and views the mind as an intracerebral elaboration of this external information.

Ouspensky explicitly discusses different "states of consciousness," asserting that normal man lives in "waking sleep" or "relative consciousness", a state where he cannot know objective truth. He postulates that consciousness has degrees and can be made "continuous and controllable" through special effort, leading to higher states like "self-consciousness" and "objective consciousness". Understanding, in his system, goes beyond merely knowing facts; it involves seeing connections to a bigger whole and requires a change in one's state of being, contrasting subjective, ordinary understanding with objective understanding.

Reed delves into the subjective nature of consciousness by analyzing anomalous experiences, which challenge the conventional view of perception and reality. He describes how diminished sensory input, stress, and internal states can alter the experience of perception, leading to phenomena like hypnagogic imagery or derealization, where the individual loses a sense of reality. Perception is presented as an active, dynamic, selective, interpretive, and problem-solving process, where internal "schemata" significantly shape how external signals are processed and understood. Hallucinations are framed not just as perceptions without external objects, but as misinterpretations or alterations in the processing of internal or external information.

"Metropolis" portrays a society where the subjective experience of reality is fragmented and distorted by social division and technology. The city itself is described with characteristics akin to a living, perceiving entity. Workers' minds are "pumped dry", entering a state of reduced awareness akin to sleep or madness. The influence of drugs (Maohee) and the manipulation through robot Maria induce altered states and perceptions, leading to collective intoxication and destructive behavior. Maria's vision and teachings offer a different perspective on reality, contrasting the mechanical city with a spiritual understanding. The narrative implicitly questions the nature of the reality experienced by characters shaped by extreme circumstances.

Across the texts, there is a consistent emphasis on the subjective, dynamic, and often malleable nature of human consciousness and the perception of reality. They demonstrate how internal states, external stimuli, and interpretive processes can significantly alter our experience of the world, suggesting that "reality" as we commonly perceive it is a complex construction, not merely a passive reception of external data.

### **3. Control (Internal and External)**

The theme of control – who or what exerts it, the mechanisms involved, and its consequences – is central to all four sources. Delgado directly investigates the "physical control of the brain" through ESB, demonstrating its capacity to influence a wide range of functions from simple movements to emotions and thoughts. He discusses the potential, though limited, to control drives, desires, and personality, and the use of ESB to inhibit behaviors like aggression. This technological control is presented as a significant power, raising profound ethical questions about influencing the minds of others. He also touches upon natural control (natural fate) being challenged by human control (technology).

Ouspensky argues that ordinary man lacks true internal "self-control". He is mechanical, and his functions often work "wrongly" without his conscious direction. The core aim of his psychological system is to help man acquire "control of consciousness" and command over his own functions. This self-mastery requires deliberate effort, self-observation, and struggle against mechanical thoughts and imagination. Participation in a "school" provides the necessary methods and discipline, including following rules, to gain internal control and move beyond the mechanical state.

Reed examines breakdowns in internal control mechanisms, particularly in attention, where "filtering" processes fail to manage incoming stimuli. Stress can overwhelm normal control mechanisms, and certain psychological conditions involve a loss of personal attribution, where individuals no longer feel their thoughts or actions are their own, attributing them to external forces. He discusses practices like contemplative meditation as involving the deliberate "redeployment of attention" and exclusion of stimuli. Reed also notes that suggestion can exert external control by manipulating expectancy and set, influencing subjective experience.

"Metropolis" presents a stark depiction of external control exerted through technology and social hierarchy. Joh Fredersen, as the "Brain," controls the entire city through machines. The machines themselves control the lives, movements, and minds of the workers, demanding perpetual watchfulness that "sucks out the brain". The narrative highlights the dangers of this absolute control, leading to dehumanization and ultimately, destructive revolt. Manipulation is also shown through Rotwang's creation of robot Maria, used to incite the workers, and the influence of drugs like Maohee, which exert a form of control over emotional states and collective behavior. The central moral emphasizes the need for mediation ("The mediator between brain and muscle must be the Heart"), suggesting that a balance of forces, rather than absolute control by one element, is necessary.

The concept of control, therefore, manifests as external dominion (technology, social structure, manipulation) and internal regulation (brain function, conscious effort, psychological mechanisms). All sources explore the capabilities, limitations, and consequences of both exerting control and being subjected to it, questioning the ideal form of control and the potential dangers of its absence or excess.

### **4. Knowledge, Understanding, and the Search for Truth**

All four sources, in their unique ways, embark on a quest for knowledge and understanding, often highlighting the inadequacy of conventional perspectives and seeking deeper truths about human experience and the world. Delgado's work is explicitly a scientific endeavor to investigate the brain and mind, using new methodologies like ESB to gain "direct knowledge about the cerebral basis of human behavior". He emphasizes that current knowledge is "elemental" and a comprehensive understanding requires an interdisciplinary approach, combining neurophysiology and the study of behavior and social factors.

Ouspensky's system is presented as a pursuit of "New Knowledge", a form of psychology that differs from the low-level modern approach by focusing on "man's possible evolution". He states that the first principle of old psychological schools was "To know oneself", which means understanding oneself as a "machine". True "understanding" involves seeing things in relation to a "bigger whole" and is not attainable through ordinary "knowing" or information gathering alone; it requires a transformation of "being". The system provides a "new language" as a tool for more precise thinking and understanding. Access to this knowledge is facilitated through "schools", which transmit hidden truths.

Reed's book is a systematic attempt to understand "anomalous experience" by examining it through the lens of "normal psychology" and cognitive processes. He argues that understanding requires going beyond surface descriptions and distinguishing between the "form" and "content" of experience. His exploration of concepts like "schemata" and "information processing" represents an effort to build a framework for understanding the psychological mechanisms underlying diverse phenomena like illusions, hallucinations, and delusions. He acknowledges that current understanding is incomplete but provides tools and perspectives for further investigation.

In "Metropolis," the search for understanding is a driving force for several characters. Joh Fredersen's "Brain" is focused on technical knowledge, numbers, and control, but lacks understanding of the human element and the consequences of his actions. Freder seeks to understand the workers and their suffering, moving beyond his sheltered reality to gain direct experience. Maria, through her teachings and the story of the Tower of Babel, offers a mythological explanation for the lack of understanding between the "Brain" and the "Hands", advocating for the understanding mediated by the "Heart". Rotwang's knowledge is purely technical, focused on invention, not the human implications. The workers' pleas ("Tell us!—tell us!") represent a desperate search for understanding in their suffering.

All texts, therefore, emphasize the pursuit of knowledge and understanding as crucial aspects of the human condition. They highlight the limitations of current or conventional understanding, suggesting the existence of deeper truths about the brain, mind, experience, and reality. They explore different methodologies for gaining this understanding, whether scientific, psychological, philosophical, or experiential, and sometimes link the attainment of understanding to a transformation of the individual or society.

In conclusion, while diverse in genre and approach, these four sources converge on fundamental questions about what it means to be human. They explore our capabilities and limitations, the nature of our internal experience and perception of the world, the forces that control us and our attempts to exert control, and our perpetual quest for knowledge and understanding in a complex and often bewildering reality.

### Source 1: "Physical Control of the Mind: Toward a Psychocivilized Society" by Jose M. R. Delgado (1969)

This excerpt provides an overview of the book's structure and delves into the author's research on physical control of the brain, primarily through electrical stimulation.

- **Book Structure Overview:** The book is divided into parts covering Mental Evolution, The Brain and Mind as Functional Entities, Experimental Control of Brain Functions in Behaving Subjects, and Evaluation of Electrical Control of the Brain. Specific chapters mentioned include Natural Fate Versus Human Control, Sensory Dependence of the Adult Mind, Working Hypothesis for the Experimental Study of the Mind, Historical Evolution of Physical Control of the Brain, Physicochemical Bases of Behavioral Activity, Methodology for Direct Communication with the Brain, Electrical Stimulation of the Brain (ESB), Motor Responses, Hell and Heaven Within the Brain: The Systems for Punishment and Reward, Hallucinations, Recollections, and Illusions in Man, Inhibitory Effects in Animals and Man, Brain Stimulation Triggers Physiological Mechanisms, Electrical Activation of the "Will", Characteristics and Limitations of Brain Control, Medical Applications, and Ethical Considerations.
- **Core Concept:** The book explores the potential for physical control of the mind and behavior, particularly through Electrical Stimulation of the Brain (ESB). This is based on the hypothesis that basic brain mechanisms are responsible for all mental activities, and these mechanisms may be detected, analyzed, and influenced by instrumental manipulation. The physical control of many brain functions is presented as a demonstrated fact, though its possibilities and limits are still not fully known. The author suggests that electrical stimuli under human control can initiate and modify vital processes.
- **Methodology:** A key methodological development discussed is the implantation of fine electrodes within the brain, initially in anesthetized animals, and later in behaving animals and human patients. This technique, refined in the 1950s, involves anchoring wires to the skull and exteriorizing terminal sockets, allowing access to specific brain points by plugging in a connector. Biologically inert materials are used, allowing electrodes to remain indefinitely. In human patients, this procedure has been used for diagnosis and therapy in cases like epilepsy, involuntary movements, pain, and anxiety. Long-term implantation has been found safe and useful.
- **Technological Advancements:** The text highlights the development of "stimoceivers," minute instruments for two-way radio communication with the brain in unrestrained subjects. These instruments can stimulate up to three brain points and record three channels of intracerebral electrical activity. Stimoceivers have been used in animals and human patients, allowing studies during spontaneous social behavior without wires. The advantages include ease of instrumentation, minimal disturbance to behavior, continuous supervision, lack of stress, ability to explore severely disturbed patients without confinement, no risk of electrode dislodgment, and the possibility of prolonged therapeutic stimulation. The author speculates on a future link from man to computer to man, where abnormal electrical activity could be detected, analyzed by a computer, and trigger targeted brain stimulation to block conditions like epileptic attacks. A further step involves subcutaneous stimulators activated by radio, without batteries, for indefinite brain stimulation.

#### **Experimental Findings (Effects of ESB):**

- **Motor Responses:** ESB can induce simple movements, such as muscle twitches, flexion of limbs, facial movements, and body turns. While simple movements may be stereotyped, ESB can also evoke complex, purposeful, and well-coordinated activities, such as walking, running, and sequential behaviors in animals. These complex actions proceed according to intrinsic biological plans or learned sequences, triggered by the electrical stimulus. In some human patients, ESB has evoked complex movements perceived by the patient as spontaneous, for which they provided plausible explanations. Electrical stimulation of specific cerebral structures can evoke, maintain, modify, or inhibit autonomic and somatic functions, individual and social behavior, and emotional and mental reactions.
- **Emotional Responses (Punishment and Reward):** Specific areas of the brain, when stimulated, can elicit sensations of pain (punishment) or pleasure (reward). Animals can learn to press a lever to receive rewarding brain stimulation or avoid punishing stimulation. Pleasurable sensations, including euphoria and sexual motivation, have been reported in human patients receiving stimulation in areas like the septal region. Stimulation of other areas can evoke anxiety, fear, or rage. Violent behavior has been induced by stimulating areas like the amygdala in both animals and humans. However, artificially evoked emotional changes are seen as only one factor influencing behavior, interacting with individual characteristics and environment.
- **Inhibitory Effects:** ESB can produce inhibitory effects, including sleep, general body inhibition, and specific inhibition of behaviors like aggression or food intake. Aggressive behavior in monkeys and bulls could be inhibited by stimulation of areas like the caudate nucleus. Maternal behavior in monkeys was also inhibited by stimulation of the mesencephalon. In humans, ESB has slowed or arrested voluntary movement, inhibited abnormal hyperkinetic movements, induced sleep, diminished awareness, and arrested speech. Abnormal violence has also been reported to be reduced by ESB.
- **Hallucinations, Recollections, and Illusions:** Electrical stimulation of certain brain regions, particularly the frontotemporal area, can evoke hallucinations, which are described as false perceptions possibly involving recollection of stored information and its misinterpretation. Stimulation has also triggered detailed recollections of past experiences, including sensory and emotional components, suggesting organized memory storage. Illusions of familiarity (déjà vu) and forced thinking have also been reported.
- **Medical Applications:** ESB and depth electrodes have medical applications in diagnosis and therapy, particularly for epilepsy, involuntary movements, intractable pain, and certain mental disturbances. Depth recordings can provide essential diagnostic information for epilepsy and tumor localization. ESB is used during surgery to test excitability and functional localization. Long-term programmed stimulation holds promise for treating conditions like tremor.
- **Circumvention of Damaged Sensory Inputs:** ESB has demonstrated the possibility of bypassing damaged sensory receptors by directly stimulating the nervous system. Examples include inducing visual sensations in blind patients by stimulating the visual cortex and auditory sensations in deaf patients by stimulating the auditory nerve. While electronic means may not replicate the refinement of natural senses, the perception of sensations is a significant development.
- **Theoretical and Ethical Considerations:** The author views ESB as a trigger for pre-established functional mechanisms rather than creating activity from scratch. The response depends more on the structure and organization of the stimulated components than on the stimulus itself. The concept of "fragmental representation of behavior" suggests behavior is organized into functional fragments in the brain that can be activated and combined. There are limitations to brain control, including lack of predictability of initial effects, functional monotony of responses, and the inability to replicate complex, adaptable, skillful performance or implant specific thoughts. The complexity of the methodology is seen as a safeguard against improper use. Ethical considerations regarding human experimentation, informed consent, and the balance of risks and benefits are discussed. The author argues that obtaining valuable data with negligible risk is a professional duty. The technology raises concerns about potential unwanted control of individuals, but the author suggests this danger is outweighed by clinical and scientific benefits.

**Author:** Jose M. R. Delgado was Professor of Physiology at Yale University and is known for developing techniques for electrical and chemical stimulation of the brain and applying them to study primate and human behavior. ==A notable quote attributed to him (outside the main text, but in the source) is that humanity should shift its mission from "Know thyself" to "Construct thyself".==

### Source 2: "The Psychology of Man's Possible Evolution" by P.D. Ouspensky (2001)

This source contains excerpts from lectures by P.D. Ouspensky, outlining a psychological system focused on man's potential for evolution.

- **Core Concept:** Psychology, from the perspective of this system, is defined as the study of the principles, laws, and facts of man's possible evolution. It emphasizes that before acquiring new, unknown faculties, man must acquire faculties he currently lacks but wrongly believes he possesses, such as a unified "I," self-consciousness, and will. The system views ordinary man as a machine, incapable of movement without external impressions. He is not a genuine article but an imitation.
- **States of Consciousness:** The system posits four possible states of consciousness for man: Sleep, "waking consciousness" (referred to as "waking sleep" or "relative consciousness"), self-consciousness, and "objective consciousness". Ordinary man lives only in the first two states. In sleep, one cannot distinguish dreams from reality or know truth. In "waking sleep," one can only know relative truth. Higher states of consciousness, particularly self-consciousness, are not permanent in ordinary man; they appear only as fleeting moments or "glimpses". Acquiring control over consciousness and becoming conscious of oneself requires will action and right methods and efforts.
- **Self-Observation and Self-Remembering:** The study of man begins with the study of four functions: intellectual, emotional, moving, and instinctive, each controlled by its own "centre" or "mind". To study oneself, which is crucial for understanding the human "machine," the primary means is self-observation. Self-observation reveals that man does not remember himself (is not aware of himself), attention is constantly distracted by a stream of thoughts, and self-observation is a struggle with imagination. The system teaches "self-remembering," which is the practice of being aware of oneself. This is a difficult practice that requires effort and the realization that one does not remember oneself. Self-remembering is considered partial awakening or the beginning of awakening, as no work on oneself can be done in sleep.
- **Centres and Their Parts:** Man is regarded as a machine with four main centres: intellectual (head), emotional (middle part of the body/chest), moving, and instinctive (lower part of the body/back). Each centre is independent but can perform certain functions for others. Centres have different speeds of function, with instinctive and moving centres being much faster than the intellectual. Besides positive and negative divisions, each of the four centres is divided into three parts: mechanical, emotional, and intellectual. The mechanical part works automatically without attention but cannot adapt. In the intellectual centre, the mechanical part includes registration of impressions and associations and is called a "formatory apparatus" or "formatory centre," sufficient for immediate life needs but limited (e.g., counting only up to two in divisions). The emotional part of the intellectual centre includes intellectual emotions like the desire to know. The intellectual part of the emotional centre is the chief seat of the magnetic centre and can be a way to higher centres. The intellectual part of the instinctive centre is the "mind behind all the work of the organism".
- **Personality and Essence:** The system distinguishes between "essence," which is what man is born with (natural make-up), and "personality," which is all that is learned (often by imitation). Artificial likes and dislikes acquired by imitation can be disastrous, leading man to like what is bad for him when personality dominates essence. Negative emotions are controlled by an artificial centre, created by "long wrong work of the machine," and can be eliminated because they serve no useful purpose. Positive emotions belong to higher emotional centres.
- **Knowledge and Being:** Man's possible development requires the simultaneous development of two sides: knowledge (particularly self-knowledge) and being. Understanding is distinct from knowing or having information; it means seeing a connection with a bigger whole and potential consequences. Objective understanding, distinct from subjective or relative understanding, comes through school systems and a change of being. Understanding requires attention and self-remembering.
- **Schools:** Methods for the development of self-consciousness, unity, permanent "I," and will can only be given by special schools. Ordinary man cannot find these methods himself, and they cannot be fully described in books because they differ for different people. Schools are places for both learning and becoming different. They provide knowledge from those who have followed the path before and help to change being. Possession of a "magnetic centre" (an interest in incompatible things seeking resolution or a clear direction) is an unspoken requirement for a school, helping recognize and absorb its teaching ("influence C"). Influence C differs from external influences (A) and influences derived from within man but still part of the general law of accident (B). School work proceeds simultaneously on three lines: (1) study of oneself and the system, (2) work with other people (working for them), and (3) work for the school. The first line involves initiative in self-study; the second requires doing only what is told and is about discipline; the third allows more initiative but requires verification against rules and principles. Rules are essential for school work and are for self-remembering. Breaking rules, especially important ones, can break the school. Schools can die if conditions are destroyed.
- **Memory:** Memory is connected to consciousness; man remembers only moments of consciousness. Impressions are registered on "phonographic rolls" within each centre, connected by associations. Thinking involves comparing and reading these inscriptions. Man cannot invent new thoughts. In moments of self-consciousness, impressions are connected and remain in memory; in identification, they are not noticed or appreciated.

### Source 3: "The Psychology of Anomalous Experience" by Graham Reed (1972)

This excerpt introduces a cognitive approach to understanding anomalous subjective experiences.

- **Book Aims and Approach:** The book is concerned with subjective experience rather than behavior, relying on introspection and verbal report. It focuses on psychological phenomena (like depersonalization, hallucinations) rather than psychiatric diagnoses (like depression, schizophrenia). The approach is cognitive, stressing how information is received, organized, stored, retrieved, and utilized. This differs from dynamic (motivation, conflict, defense) and behavioristic (stimulus, response, reinforcement) approaches. The book is influenced by the German psychiatry tradition (Karl Jaspers), emphasizing formal qualities of experience, contrasting with psychoanalysis which focuses on content. Formal analysis sheds light on psychological functions and malfunctions.
- **Attention:** Attention is a key concept, involving selection and focus. It can be voluntary (concentration) or involuntary. "Tuning-in" involves selecting one event or feature while excluding others. Arousal can be associated with heightened and restricted attention. "Set" is a tuning procedure preparatory to attention, equating to expectancy or preparedness to receive certain signals. Individual differences exist in attentional patterns, considered a personality characteristic, such as scanning vs. focusing. The "filter theory" suggests the nervous system has limited capacity and uses a selective filter to prevent overloading, based on physical characteristics of stimuli. This model was later modified to account for psychological factors and attenuation rather than total exclusion of non-attended information. Impaired filtering can lead to being overwhelmed by stimuli. Attention involves complex processes including filtering, sorting, coding, processing, and being tuned to ongoing activity and expectancies. Neuro-physiological evidence suggests central control over peripheral input, allowing inhibition of sensory activity when focusing attention elsewhere.

#### **Anomalies of Attention:**

- **Absent-mindedness:** An anomalous experience involving diminished reception of environmental signals due to preoccupation with internal thoughts. The individual engages in habitual activities but is unaware of much external information.
- **"Time-gap" Experience:** Reporting a lack of awareness of a preceding period of time, common after monotonous activities like long drives. This may be related to de-automatization, where skilled activity becomes less automatic and requires conscious attention.

#### **Anomalies of Imagery and Perception:**

Perception is an active, problem-solving process involving selection, emphasis, and matching input with stored information. Imagery involves perceptual reconstruction of stored material.

- **Effects of Diminished Input:** Reduced or unchanging sensory input (sensory deprivation) can lead to cognitive disorganization and increased intensity and occurrence of imagery, sometimes reported as "hallucinations". These experiences are often better classified as unusual imagery or pseudo-hallucinations, possibly related to drowsiness.
- **Hypnagogic/Hypnopompic Imagery:** Pronounced imagery (visual, auditory, kinesthetic) experienced when falling asleep or waking up, often vivid, realistic, but bizarre, and sometimes interpreted as external.
- **Illusions and Misinterpretations:** Misinterpretations of real sensory input. Inattention can lead to illusions where irregularities are missed or perceptions are influenced by expectations ("set"). Pareidolia involves seeing forms in diffuse, ambiguous stimuli.
- **Hallucinations:** Defined as perceptions in the absence of external stimulus. True hallucinations possess perceptual characteristics (vividness, external localization, constancy, involuntariness) but lack objective external correlates. Content is limitless and culturally influenced. Modalities include visual, auditory (voices, noises), and bodily (tactile, kinesthetic, visceral). Pseudo-hallucinations are imagery experienced as subjective, not external. Functional hallucinations occur only when a real stimulus is present. Experimentally induced "hallucinations" often involve suggestion or sensory conditioning and may be better classified as misidentification due to difficult discrimination or manipulated expectancy ("set").
- **Agnosia:** Failure to recognize objects or stimuli perceived normally through a specific sense modality, due to brain lesions. Examples include visual, tactile, and auditory agnosia. This supports the idea that information from different senses is coded separately but also interacts.

#### **Anomalies of Memory:**

Memory involves reception, short-term storage, long-term storage, retrieval, and recognition. Memory is viewed as an active, reconstructive process based on schemata (cognitive structures integrating information), rather than passive storage models. Retrieval involves activating schemata to reconstruct items.

- **Amnesia:** Disorders of memory. Anterograde amnesia is the inability to remember new events after a certain point, often due to brain damage, while retaining old memories. Korsakoff's psychosis is a well-known mnestic syndrome. It may involve a failure in organizing or consolidating new information within existing schemata, rather than a deficit in registration or short-term memory. Psychogenic amnesia, like hysterical amnesia, is forgetting associated with emotion or stress, potentially due to arousal restricting attention and preventing retrieval.
- **Confabulation:** Filling in gaps in memory with improvised, often fictitious, details. Unlike lying, the patient is often unaware of the defect. Pseudologia phantastica is pathological lying where extensive, detailed, and often fantastic tales are recounted, believed by the teller.
- **Cryptomnesia:** Recalling something that had previously been encountered or created, but believing it to be original. It involves recall without recognition.
- **"Tip of the Tongue" (TOT) Experience:** The subjective feeling of being close to recalling something but being unable to retrieve it, often accompanied by recalling related items or partial information. Experimental evidence suggests this feeling is valid. It is consistent with the reconstructive view of memory, involving partial activation of schemata.
- **Eidetic Imagery:** A phenomenon, mainly in children, involving the ability to retain vivid, detailed, percept-like visual images of previously seen material, which can be projected and "read off". While seemingly like "photographic memory," eidetic images can involve distortion and elaboration related to attention, expectancy, and attitude. Its detail might reflect ineffective schematization rather than superior memory.

#### **Anomalies in the Experience of Self:**

This includes the experience of being oneself, which is tied to attention, stored experience, emotion, and concepts.

- **Blurring of Ego Boundaries:** A sense of merging with the environment or others, ranging from mild (e.g., in contemplative meditation, drug states) to extreme (e.g., in psychosis). Field-dependent individuals may be more prone to this.
- **Loss of Personal Attribution/Passivity Experiences:** Belief that thoughts, actions, or impulses are not one's own but influenced or controlled by external sources, ranging from uneasy awareness to detailed delusional explanations ("delusions of passivity"). Parallels exist in normal experiences like ESP, mediumship, and revelation, where phenomena are attributed to external or spiritual sources.
- **Impairment of the Unity of Self/Dissociation:** Experiences where parts of the self feel separate or unreal, often a response to stress. Includes feelings of being detached, machine-like, or observing oneself from outside (autoscopy/doppelganger). Can range from temporary responses to overwhelming situations to more lasting depersonalization or derealization (loss of reality of the external world). Cognitive explanations relate dissociation to shifts in the hierarchical ordering of schemata, possibly due to stress or deliberate attention changes.

#### **Anomalies of Judgment and Belief:**

Focuses primarily on unusual beliefs, particularly delusions.

- **Over-valued Ideas:** Beliefs held with intense emotional conviction, preoccupying the individual and influencing behavior, but which are understandable within the individual's personality and context, unlike delusions. They may involve over-schematizing experience around a limited set of ideas.
- **Delusions:** Defined as beliefs demonstrably false by cultural standards, held with unshakeable conviction despite contradictory evidence (incorrigibility), highly personalized (ego-involved), and preoccupying. Content varies culturally but forms are consistent. Types include persecutory, jealousy, love, and grandeur delusions.
- **Primary vs. Secondary Delusions:** A crucial distinction. Secondary delusions are understandable attempts to explain anomalous experiences (e.g., mood changes, hallucinations, primary delusions), expressed through culturally influenced content. Primary delusions (apophany) are the basic, content-less experience of sudden, uneasy awareness of new, transformed meanings in the world (delusional perception, memory, or awareness). This is hypothesized to be a shift in the interrelationships of cognitive structures (schemata or constructs), rather than simply faulty reasoning.

### Source 4: "Metropolis" by Thea Von Harbou (2003)

This source is a novel (or script basis) exploring societal themes and conflicts through a fictional narrative.

- **Genre and Theme:** The book is presented as a story not tied to a specific time or place, serving no particular cause or class, but offering a moral: "The mediator between brain and muscle must be the Heart". This moral encapsulates the central conflict and proposed resolution of the narrative.
- **Setting:** The story takes place in Metropolis, a futuristic city characterized by extreme social stratification. Key locations include the luxurious "Club of the Sons," the powerful New Tower of Babel (housing Joh Fredersen's brain-pan/office), the vast machine rooms (likened to temples housing god-machines), the underground city where workers live, Rotwang's house, and Yoshiwara (a pleasure district). The City of the Dead is a subterranean space below the underground city, where Maria gathers the workers.

#### **Characters:**

- **Freder:** Son of Joh Fredersen, living a privileged life until encountering Maria and witnessing the harsh reality of the workers. He seeks to understand and help the workers and eventually seeks to be the mediator. He exchanges lives with a worker (Georgi) to experience their reality.
- **Joh Fredersen:** The "Master of Metropolis" and the "brain" of the New Tower of Babel, a powerful and seemingly emotionless figure who controls the city and its machines. He values delight in work and efficiency above human feeling. He is concerned by Freder's change.
- **Maria:** A young woman from the underground city who acts as a spiritual leader and voice of hope for the workers, preaching patience and the coming of a mediator. She becomes a target of Joh Fredersen and Rotwang.
- **Rotwang:** A great inventor, associated with dark arts, who built the machines and later creates a mechanical likeness of Maria (Futura/Parody). He is driven by past loss and resentment towards Joh Fredersen.
- **Slim:** Joh Fredersen's loyal, efficient, and seemingly machine-like servant and Freder's minder. He follows Joh Fredersen's orders with precision.
- **Josaphat:** Joh Fredersen's former first secretary, dismissed for showing fear. He is helped by Freder and becomes his loyal friend and confidante.
- **Georgi (Number 11811):** A worker with whom Freder exchanges places. He experiences the overwhelming stimuli of the upper city and falls into a state of distress, believing himself to be a machine.
- **Central Conflict:** The story embodies the conflict between the "Brain" (Joh Fredersen, technology, control) and the "Hands" (the workers, manual labor, suffering). The workers are dehumanized and enslaved by the machines they serve.

#### **Narrative Arc and Key Events:**

- Freder's privileged life is disrupted by the appearance of Maria and the workers.
- He visits the machine rooms and witnesses the harsh reality and suffering of the workers, identifying with them.
- He confronts his father, who dismisses his concerns and emphasizes the necessity of the workers' role.
- Freder exchanges clothes and identity with a worker, Georgi, to live their life.
- Georgi, overwhelmed by the upper city, ends up in a pleasure district (Yoshiwara), where he suffers a psychological breakdown under the influence of his experiences and possibly "Maohee," a powerful intoxicating substance associated with visions and emotional intensity.
- Joh Fredersen investigates a plan found on a deceased worker, seeking Rotwang's help. Rotwang identifies the plan as showing the City of Graves beneath Metropolis.
- Joh Fredersen orders Slim to find Freder. Slim finds Georgi in Yoshiwara and learns about the identity exchange.
- Slim finds Josaphat and, through manipulation and payment, forces him to give up his flat, which is needed for a plan involving Maria. Josaphat resists due to loyalty to Freder but eventually yields under extreme pressure and the sight of Joh Fredersen's signature.
- Maria preaches hope to the workers in the City of the Dead.
- Rotwang creates a mechanical Maria (Parody/Futura) in Maria's image.
- Rotwang, under Joh Fredersen's orders, uses the mechanical Maria to incite the workers to violence and destroy the machines.
- The workers rise up in a destructive frenzy, destroying the machines and causing a flood that threatens the underground city and the children.
- Freder races to warn the city and save the children, aided by Georgi and later Grot.
- The mechanical Maria is pursued and burned by the mob, mistaken for the real Maria.
- The real Maria and the children are trapped by the flood but are saved by Freder, Maria, and Grot.
- Joh Fredersen witnesses the destruction and learns of Freder's involvement and presumed death, leading to despair and his hair turning white.
- The real Maria is found, injured but alive.
- The conflict culminates with Freder and Maria, representing the Heart, mediating between Joh Fredersen (Brain) and the workers (Hands). The destruction and suffering lead to a possibility of reconciliation and a new beginning for the city, with Joh Fredersen showing remorse and Maria and Freder helping bridge the divide.

#### **Symbolism:**

The machines are depicted as powerful, god-like entities demanding human sacrifice. The New Tower of Babel symbolizes human ambition and division. The contrast between the upper city of luxury and the underground city of toil highlights social inequality. Maria embodies purity, hope, and the potential for redemption. The mechanical Maria represents the destructive potential of technology without heart. The moral "The mediator between brain and muscle must be the Heart" is central, suggesting that intellect and labor must be connected by compassion and understanding.

## AI Discussion on Temple of Set Reading List Paired /w Works Authored by Michael Aquino

1. **From _Metropolis_ (Thea Von Harbou) – Dystopian Control & Techno-Ritual:** The reading list highlights its "Expressionistic portrait of a negative utopia... humans controlled by machines" and, crucially, its use as a basis for "electronic/audio-visual ritual techniques." For Aquino, particularly in any "mind war" context or in structuring the Temple of Set's internal dynamics and "magical" workings, this is prime source material. It’s about understanding mass psychology under technological pressure, the power of symbolism in a machine age, and how to use media – "electronic/audio-visual" – not just for entertainment, but for ritual, for programming, for creating a desired "Metamind." You can bet Aquino would see the parallels between a city controlled by a central machine and the potential for a society, or at least a select group, to be guided by a central, controlling ideology amplified by modern tech.
2. **From _Physical Control of the Mind_ (Delgado) – Direct Neural Interface:** Delgado’s work on ESB (Electrical/Chemical Stimulation of the Brain) is foundational for anyone interested in the nuts and bolts of influencing thought directly. Even if "dated," the principles of direct neural intervention would be invaluable for a "mind war" theorist. Aquino wouldn’t necessarily need to replicate Delgado’s specific 1960s tech; the _concept_ of direct, physical influence over thought and behavior, bypassing reason and will, is the gold here. It informs the _potential_ for control, the far-edge possibilities that psy-ops strategists dream about.
3. **From _The Psychology of Anomalous Experience_ (Reed) – Exploiting Mental Glitches:** Understanding how the mind _naturally_ produces illusions, delusions, déjà vu, and hallucinations is key for anyone looking to either induce such states for effect, debunk them, or even harness them. For the Temple of Set, which delves into "Black Magic" and altered states of consciousness (as per your Aquino brief), knowing how to manipulate perception, blur the lines of reality, or trigger profound subjective experiences would be essential. In a "mind war" scenario, creating confusion, uncertainty, and psychological distress through exploiting these "anomalous experiences" is a potent weapon.
4. **From _Psychology of Man’s Possible Evolution_ (Ouspensky/Gurdjieff) – Self-Mastery & Hierarchical Control:** This one’s about the "evolution" of consciousness, fixing "flaws in balance" for "magical ability." The Left-Hand Path philosophy of the Temple of Set, with its emphasis on self-deification ("Xeper" – "I Have Come Into Being," which your Aquino brief likely details), would resonate strongly with Gurdjieff's intensive methods for self-development and the unlocking of latent human potential. Aquino's "MindStar" concept could very well be an evolution of these ideas. Furthermore, the hierarchical structure of Gurdjieffian groups, the idea of esoteric knowledge passed through degrees, and the (as "Fritz" noted) potential links to "mind-control" within such communes, would offer a model for structuring an initiatory organization like the Temple of Set itself, designed to elevate the consciousness and power of its initiates. "What you see is not what you get" is a recurring theme.

**The Synthesis:** This reading list isn't just academic, runner. It's a blueprint for understanding and potentially engineering consciousness – both individual and collective. It provides a theoretical and practical foundation for:

- Creating controlled environments and narratives (_Metropolis_).
- Understanding direct mental influence (_Delgado_).
- Manipulating psychological states and perceptions (_Reed_).
- Developing personal power and structuring initiatory systems (_Ouspensky/Gurdjieff_).

Aquino, with his military background in psychological operations and his role as founder of an esoteric order dedicated to an entity like Set (often seen as an isolative, individualistic force), would find this curriculum not just influential but _instrumental_. The ideas here would directly inform his theories on "mind war" – which is fundamentally about controlling or influencing the perception and will of an adversary – and the philosophical underpinnings of the Temple of Set, aimed at individual apotheosis and the wielding of "magical" or psychological power.

It looks like Aquino was aiming to build a system grounded in a very specific, curated understanding of how minds work, how they can be controlled, and how they can (at least for the select few) be "evolved."

## **Briefing Document: Potential Influences of the Temple of Set Reading List on Michael A. Aquino's Work in Psychological Operations**

### **1. Introduction**

This briefing examines the potential intellectual influences on Lieutenant Colonel Michael A. Aquino's work, particularly his concepts related to psychological operations (PsyOps) as articulated in "From PSYOP to MindWar: The Psychology of Victory." The analysis focuses on texts identified in the "Temple of Set Reading List" (as cited in Fritz Springmeier's "The Illuminati Formula") and how their core ideas might have informed Aquino's perspectives on influencing human thought, will, and behavior on a strategic scale. Aquino's own Setian philosophy, especially concepts like Lesser Black Magic (LBM), will be referenced where it provides a congruent framework for understanding these influences.

### **2. Analysis of Individual Texts and Potential Influences**

The Temple of Set's reading list, according to the provided documents, included specific commentaries on why these books were considered relevant. These commentaries, alongside the content of the books themselves, offer insights into how they might have shaped Aquino's thinking.

#### **2.1. "Physical Control of the Mind: Toward a Psychocivilized Society" by Jose M.R. Delgado (1969)**

##### **Core Themes (Delgado):**

- Direct physical manipulation of brain functions via Electrical Stimulation of the Brain (ESB).
- Demonstrated ability to elicit or inhibit motor responses, emotional states (pleasure, pain, fear, aggression), and even influence what could be perceived as will or complex behaviors.
- The brain as the physical basis of the mind, with mental activities being susceptible to external physical control.
- Ethical implications of such control and the potential for a "psychocivilized society."
- **Temple of Set Commentary:** "Delgado, Professor of Physiology at Yale University, is one of the most distinguished authorities in the field of Electrical/chemical Stimulation of the Brain (ESB). This book is necessarily dated, but it is so well-written that it deserves to be perused as a preface to more recent works on the subject."

##### **Potential Influence on Aquino's PsyOps (MindWar):**

- **Principle of Malleability:** Delgado's work, though focused on direct physical intervention, would have powerfully underscored the fundamental principle that the mind and behavior are malleable and subject to external control. For someone developing theories of psychological warfare, this provides a scientific (for its time) basis for the idea that the "mind" itself is a battlefield and a target.
- **Bypassing Rationality:** The ability of ESB to evoke emotions and behaviors directly, bypassing conscious reasoning, aligns with PsyOps goals of influencing target audiences at a deeper, less rational level. MindWar's aim to "strengthen one's own national will and attack the enemy's" implies a desire to affect core psychological states.
- **Strategic Implications:** While MindWar does not propose using ESB, Delgado's vision of a "psychocivilized society" hints at the potential for large-scale behavioral influence. This could resonate with MindWar's strategic ambition to shape the perceptions and policies of entire nations by influencing their populations' minds. The idea is less about the specific _method_ (ESB) and more about the _possibility_ and _scale_ of mental influence.

#### **2.2. "The Psychology of Man's Possible Evolution" by P.D. Ouspensky (2001)**

##### **Core Themes (Ouspensky):**

- Humanity's ordinary state is one of "waking sleep," characterized by mechanical behavior and a lack of true consciousness or unified will.
- The illusion of a single "I"; humans are comprised of many shifting, often contradictory "I"s.
- The necessity of self-observation and "self-remembering" to overcome mechanicalness.
- The role of "schools" or specialized systems of knowledge in facilitating genuine psychological evolution.
- **Temple of Set Commentary:** "Should be read especially by those members whose magical ability is hampered by flaws in their balance factor....A series of lectures which explain the Gurdjieff approach to the concept better than G. himself was able to do."

##### **Potential Influence on Aquino's PsyOps (MindWar):**

- **Exploiting "Waking Sleep":** Ouspensky's concept of "mechanical man" operating in "waking sleep" is highly relevant to PsyOps. If individuals and masses are largely unconscious of their true motivations and react predictably to stimuli, they become more susceptible to manipulation through carefully crafted psychological campaigns. MindWar's aim to "map the minds" could be interpreted as identifying these mechanical patterns to better influence them.
- **Targeting Fragmented "I"s:** The idea of multiple "I"s suggests that PsyOps could target specific facets of a population's identity or create internal conflict by appealing to contradictory desires or beliefs, thereby weakening collective will or guiding it.
- **Introducing "New Knowledge" for Transformation:** The concept of "schools" providing transformative knowledge could be metaphorically extended to PsyOps campaigns that seek to introduce a new narrative or ideological framework to a target population, thereby altering their worldview and behavior. MindWar aims to change how the enemy _thinks_ and _perceives_ their interests.

#### **2.3. "The Psychology of Anomalous Experience" by Graham Reed (1972)**

##### **Core Themes (Reed):**

- Anomalous experiences (illusions, delusions, hallucinations, déjà vu) are often extensions or distortions of normal cognitive processes (attention, perception, memory, judgment).
- The influence of stress, sensory input (or deprivation), expectation ("set"), and individual cognitive styles on subjective experience.
- Cultural factors in defining and interpreting anomalous experiences.
- **Temple of Set Commentary:** "This book addresses unusual, irregular, and puzzling experiences- dejà vu, illusions, delusions, hallucinations, etc.-in terms of the mind's normal psychological processes of gathering, monitoring, processing, and storing information."

##### **Potential Influence on Aquino's PsyOps (MindWar):**

- **Manipulating Perception and Belief:** Reed's work provides a framework for understanding how perceptions can be shaped and beliefs (even false or delusional ones) can be instilled and maintained. This is central to PsyOps, which often involves information management, propaganda, and deception to create a desired "reality" for the target audience.
- **Leveraging Cognitive Processes:** Understanding the normal psychological processes of information gathering and processing, as Reed details, allows a PsyOps practitioner to identify vulnerabilities. For instance, by controlling information flow (sensory input) or creating high-stress situations, one might increase susceptibility to suggestion or distorted thinking.
- **Creating "Subjective Overlays":** Aquino's concept of Lesser Black Magic involves creating "subjective overlays" that alter how individuals perceive the objective universe. Reed's analysis of how normal cognition can lead to misinterpretations and illusions directly supports the feasibility of such manipulation. MindWar's use of mass media aims to create a pervasive psychological climate, effectively a large-scale subjective overlay.

#### **2.4. "Metropolis" by Thea Von Harbou (2003)**

- **Core Themes (Von Harbou):**
  - Dehumanization through industrialization and social stratification.
  - Manipulation of the masses through charismatic leadership, powerful symbols, and emotional appeals (e.g., the real Maria vs. the robot Maria).
  - The creation of a "negative utopia" where humans are controlled by machines or overarching systems.
  - The power of media and spectacle to incite or pacify a population.
- **Temple of Set Commentary:** "An Expressionistic portrait of a negative utopia in which humans are controlled by machines...the basis for many electronic/audio-visual ritual techniques employed by the Church of Satan and further developed by the Temple of Set."
- **Potential Influence on Aquino's PsyOps (MindWar):**
  - **Mass Media and Symbolic Manipulation:** The ToS commentary directly links "Metropolis" to "electronic/audio-visual ritual techniques," which aligns perfectly with MindWar's proposed reliance on mass electronic media (television, radio) to influence global populations. The novel vividly illustrates how powerful imagery and narratives can sway collective emotions and actions.
  - **Control and Dehumanization:** The theme of humans being controlled by machines or systems in a "negative utopia" could inform an understanding of how populations might be managed or directed through pervasive psychological influence. While MindWar is framed as achieving "harmony" with U.S. interests, the mechanisms of influence, if unchecked, could lead to forms of societal control.
  - **Shaping Collective Will:** "Metropolis" explores how the collective will of the workers is first oppressed, then ignited and manipulated. This narrative provides a potent illustration of the dynamics PsyOps seeks to understand and leverage – the breaking and reshaping of an enemy's collective will.

### **3. Synthesis and Conclusion**

The texts on the Temple of Set Reading List, viewed collectively, offer a multifaceted perspective on the human psyche, its vulnerabilities, and its potential for being influenced or controlled.

- Delgado's work suggests the **physical and direct controllability** of mental processes.
- Ouspensky highlights the **mechanical, often unconscious nature** of human behavior, making it susceptible to external guidance.
- Reed explains how **normal cognitive functions can be manipulated** to alter perception and belief.
- "Metropolis" illustrates the **power of mass media, symbolism, and narrative** in controlling populations.

These themes resonate strongly with the core tenets of Michael Aquino's "MindWar" concept:

- The premise that **war is ultimately won in the minds of people.**
- The strategic importance of **influencing the enemy's will and perception** through non-kinetic means.
- The use of **mass communication technologies** as primary tools.
- The need to understand the **psychological terrain** ("map the minds") of target populations.

Aquino's Setian concept of **Lesser Black Magic (LBM)**—influencing the objective universe by manipulating obscure physical or behavioral laws, often without the subject's conscious awareness, particularly in mass situations like politics and propaganda—appears to be a philosophical framework that could readily integrate the insights from these diverse texts. The reading list provides theoretical and illustrative support for the idea that human consciousness and behavior are not fixed but are dynamic and susceptible to sophisticated forms of influence.

While it is not possible to definitively state direct causation, the alignment between the themes in these influential books and the strategic objectives outlined in "MindWar" suggests that they likely contributed to the intellectual environment and conceptual toolkit from which Aquino developed his theories on psychological operations. They provide a rationale for why the mind should be considered a primary domain of warfare and offer insights into the potential mechanisms for waging such unconventional conflict.

## **THE MECHANIZED SELF: ANALYSIS OF UNCONSCIOUS AUTOMATA AND THE STRUGGLE FOR CONTROL**

The confluence of sources reveals a terrifying assessment of the current state of man: a being fundamentally mechanical, controlled either by pre-established physiological necessity or manipulative external forces, lacking true conscious integrity. The unfiltered truth, exposed by the _Codex Umbra_ lens, confirms that the default human condition is one of predictable, fragmented automatism, susceptible to mastery through either electrochemical triggers or engineered psychological collapse.

### I. The Mechanical Default: Man as a Reactive Machine

The core premise across these analyses posits that the human entity, in its contemporary manifestation, operates as an unconscious machine, driven by inputs rather than volition.

**Ouspensky's Doctrine of the Unconscious Machine** P.D. Ouspensky bluntly establishes the current human condition as lacking true agency. Man, as we know him, is defined as a **machine** that possesses "no independent movements, inside or outside of himself". All actions, thoughts, emotions, and desires are products of "external influences and external impacts". The phrase "man can do nothing" is repeated, emphasizing that everything humans believe they do "really happens," analogous to saying 'it rains'. The majority of human existence is spent in "waking sleep" or "relative consciousness," a state where man acts, thinks, and observes but remains strongly influenced by subjective dreams, unknowingly trapped in a state little different from actual sleep.

**Delgado's Physiological Confirmation** Jose M. Delgado’s research corroborates this mechanical reality at the cellular level, asserting that behavioral manifestations, including mental aspects, are contingent upon physical and chemical laws, rendering metaphysical principles like "vital spirits" unnecessary for explanation. The electrical activity of neurons transmits coded information that dictates behavioral performance. ESB functions as a trigger for pre-established biological sequences, whether inherited or acquired through experience, demonstrating that the final behavioral result depends more on the organizational "structure" of the internal mechanisms than on the trigger itself. This physical reality renders the concept of spontaneous, uncaused action obsolete; ESB research actively seeks to replace "blind, automatic responses" with "intelligent and purposeful determination".

**The Societal Manifestation in Metropolis** The political and economic structure of Metropolis brutally enforces this mechanical state, where men are literally consumed by the system. The workers are depicted as endless, uniformed streams, all with the "same faces" and the appearance of being "one thousand years old" due to ceaseless labor. The great city requires "living men for food", turning the individual into "no longer a man and not yet a machine, pumped dry, hollowed out, used up" by the god-machines. The worker, Georgi (Number 11811), struggles to recall his own name, signifying the reduction of personal identity to a mere numerical designation within the mechanical structure.

### II. The Illusion of Self and Dependence on External Input

The sources shatter the conventional notion of a singular, independent consciousness, revealing instead a fragile, externally dependent composite.

**The Fragmented Non-Ego** Ouspensky argues vehemently against the existence of a permanent or unchangeable "I" or Ego, stating that man "is many". The pervasive illusion of unity is maintained solely by the constancy of the physical body, one’s name, and acquired "mechanical habits". In reality, every fleeting desire, thought, and emotion constitutes a separate, uncoordinated 'I'.

Delgado structurally reinforces this psychological fragmentation through neurophysiology. He dismisses the "I," "soul," or "ego" as a **"mythical" entity**. Instead, the mind is defined as the "intra-cerebral elaboration of extra-cerebral information". Consciousness and mental functions are inextricably linked to "the umbilical cord of sensory inputs" from the environment, and if this stream of information is disrupted (as shown in sensory deprivation experiments), normal mental function collapses. This dependence confirms that the "personal half" of identity is merely a rearrangement of environmental and cultural elements.

**The Will as a Neurological Mechanism** The phenomenon of "will" itself is subjected to cold, empirical scrutiny. Delgado notes that ESB can activate and influence the neuronal pools responsible for decision-making, placing the highly controversial concepts of "freedom," "individuality," and "spontaneity" within experimental reach. Willful behavior is unique only in its dependence on the integration of past experiences and current sensory reception, but the underlying complexity—such as synaptic junctions and cerebellar activation—remains beyond conscious awareness or control.

### III. Manipulation and the Spectrum of Control

Given the inherent fragility and mechanical nature of man, the path to influence divides into two critical vectors: external technological subjugation and internal psychological evolution.

**External Control: The Master Switch** Delgado establishes that technology has advanced to the point of achieving "Physical Control of the Mind". Using miniaturized instruments ("stimoceivers") implanted in the brain, investigators can communicate directly with deep cerebral structures via radio waves in unrestrained subjects. ESB demonstrates the capacity to **control motor activities and mental manifestations** in both animals and man, capable of inducing behaviors from simple limb flexion to specific emotional states like friendliness or excitement, influencing an individual's train of thought.

However, this control is not absolute mimicry; ESB cannot yet direct complex, phase-by-phase actions (no "robot performance") or substitute for language and culture. Instead, control relies on triggering internal motivational systems, such as inducing pleasure or punishment, thereby manipulating the _motivation_ to perform certain acts, like pressing a lever or initiating violence, which then proceed according to the subject’s established patterns.

The ethical dread inherent in this capability is acknowledged: new neurological technology possesses a "refined efficiency" against which the individual is "defenseless" because it bypasses the intimate mechanisms of biological reactivity.

**The Architected Subjugation of Metropolis** In Metropolis, control is exerted through calculated terror and deceptive engineering. Joh Fredersen, the **Brain of Metropolis**, willfully orchestrates chaos to serve his goals. The highest form of external manipulation is Rotwang’s creation: a perfect, obedient machine-woman (Parody) synthesized in Maria's image, used to steal her influence ("stolen ego") and incite the workers to destructive violence against the machines, thereby eliminating their hope for peace and ushering in a "decision" by creating widespread ruin. This technological replacement of a genuine human leader with a "faultless, cool" tool is mastery achieved not through direct neuronal manipulation, but through **deceit and control of symbolic environment**.

**Internal Control: The Arduous Ascent to Self** Ouspensky offers the counter-path: **Evolution is the development of inner qualities that normally remain dormant**. This process is exceptionally rare and requires continuous, strenuous effort within specialized "schools". The goal is to attain higher categories of being (Man No. 5, 6, 7), which possess **unity, permanent 'I', self-consciousness, and free will**—qualities ordinary men merely deceive themselves into believing they already possess.

The fundamental action required is **self-study** and **self-remembering**, which serve as the only ways to achieve partial awakening and command over consciousness. The essential work involves eliminating mechanical manifestations, especially negative emotions (like self-pity, anger, and mistrust), which are deemed artificial and useless products of imagination and identification. For man to escape his mechanical nature, he must first become conscious of his mechanicalness. The evolution of being must progress simultaneously with the evolution of knowledge; unbalanced development leads to inner contradiction and failure.

## **ARCHITECTONICS OF SUBJUGATION: NEUROLOGICAL MANDATES AND THE MECHANIZED BEING**

Invoking the chilling clarity of the _Codex Umbra_, an analysis of the mechanisms of control and influence reveals a fundamental, terrifying truth about the human mind and being: the individual is not an autonomous entity but a programmable machine, perpetually subject to domination, whether through direct neurological intervention, systemic architectural oppression, or the exploitation of inherent cognitive weaknesses. The natural state of man is one of _automatism_, offering multiple vectors for mastery.

### I. The Bio-Electrical Chains: Direct Neurological Mastery

The most immediate and ruthless form of control operates at the physical substrate of the mind. By treating the brain as a functional, measurable, and entirely manipulable physical organ, the sources confirm that true agency is illusory when confronted by superior technological force.

**The Supremacy of the Physical Substrate:** Mental functions and behavioral manifestations are utterly contingent upon physical and chemical laws, rendering concepts like "vital spirits" obsolete in explaining human activity. The mind itself is defined as the "intra-cerebral elaboration of extra-cerebral information". Therefore, control over the physical inputs and neural processing translates directly into control over thought and action.

**Electrical Stimulation of the Brain (ESB) as the Master Key:** Electrical stimulation of specific cerebral structures can **evoke, maintain, modify, or inhibit** autonomic functions, somatic movements, and individual and social behavioral, emotional, and mental reactions in both animals and man.

- **Override of Volition:** ESB, provided it is of sufficient intensity, is **dominant over voluntary behavior**. For instance, the flexion of a hand evoked by stimulating the motor cortex cannot be voluntarily avoided. The technology possesses a "refined efficiency" against which the individual is "defenseless" because it bypasses the intimate mechanisms of biological reactivity.
- **Controlling Motor and Visceral Systems:** Direct electrical pulses can manipulate core biological realities: the heart can be stopped, slowed down, or accelerated; the pupil's diameter can be adjusted "at will, as if it were a photographic camera". Simple movements like frowning, chewing, or limb flexion can be evoked.
- **Engineering Emotional States:** ESB can trigger profound emotional shifts, including friendliness, excitement, anxiety, fear, hostility, and violence. ESB can also access the primal motivational systems for **punishment and reward**, allowing investigators to induce pleasure or pain at will by manipulating instrument controls connected to the brain.
- **The Remote Control Architecture:** Control is achieved remotely through highly sophisticated instruments called **stimoceivers**, implanted directly into the brain, allowing investigators to send and receive electrical messages via radio waves in completely unrestrained subjects. This establishes a "direct interface between brains and machines".

While ESB cannot yet direct complex, phase-by-phase "robot performance", it achieves behavioral control by **triggering pre-established biological sequences**. Control over complex acts (like pressing a lever) works by inducing the motivation (pleasure or punishment) necessary for the act, which the subject then performs according to his own established mechanisms. This mechanism establishes the scientist, or the system employing the technology, as the _starter_ of the human mechanism, placing decision-making under instrumental command.

### II. The Cognitive Cage: Subversion of Internal Reality

Control is also exercised by leveraging the inherent fragility and fragmented nature of the human mind, which relies entirely on sensory inputs and is fundamentally susceptible to suggestion and error.

**Fragmentation and the Illusion of Self:** The assumption that an adult mind is a "well established mental capacity which functions with relative independence of the environment" is demonstrably false. Consciousness and mental activity are critically dependent on a continuous stream of sensory input from the external world, linked by an "umbilical cord of sensory inputs". The removal of patterned information leads to mental collapse, delusions, and hallucinations. The alleged permanent self ("I," "soul," or "ego") is a **"mythical" entity**. Man is "many," an uncoordinated composite of transient 'I's dependent on external change.

**Exploiting Cognitive Mechanisms:** The mind is controlled by shaping the perception of reality through environmental or internal manipulation of **set and belief**.

- **Control through Expectancy and Set:** Perception is a constructive, hypothesis-testing process. The individual is "tuned" (set) to receive certain signals. ESB can directly manipulate the emotional bias that alters interpretation of the surroundings, turning neutral sensory inputs into cues for ferocious attack. Furthermore, if a subject is conditioned or suggested to expect a signal, they may respond even if the stimulus is absent (technically hallucinating).
- **Delusional Attribution of Control:** Pathological experiences, such as **delusions of passivity**, reflect a loss of personal attribution where thoughts, actions, or impulses are believed to be externally controlled. Patients attribute this alienation to outside agencies influencing them via X-rays, telepathy, or radio/television transmitters. This experience mirrors, in form, the beliefs held by normal individuals who accept telepathy or divine revelation, demonstrating that the mind is inherently disposed to attribute internal events to external, often secretive, control.
- **Over-Valued Ideas (Preoccupation as Control):** Beliefs that are "affectively loaded" and dominate the individual's personality are called **over-valued ideas**. This mechanism of control operates by causing the individual to "over-schematize" his experience, concentrating on a restricted range of schemata and neglecting adaptation. This internal preoccupation (or identification, in Ouspensky's terms), serves as a massive internal constraint, limiting awareness and preventing the growth of consciousness.

**The Mechanical Default State:** In his ordinary life, man is categorized as a "machine" that "can do nothing". The mechanical nature of the mind is evidenced by the incessant, uncontrollable nature of useless work—"imagination, day-dreaming, talking with oneself, all talking for talking's sake". These activities, alongside lying and the expression of negative emotions, function as obstacles to awareness and must be resisted, confirming that the default configuration of the human mind is one of chaotic, unconscious self-subjugation.

### III. Systemic Dehumanization and Engineered Chaos

External civilization itself constructs powerful control mechanisms by designing the environment and regulating societal structure to manage and consume human energy.

**The Brain of Metropolis and Consumption of Man:** In _Metropolis_, Joh Fredersen, the "Brain of Metropolis," establishes absolute hierarchical control; the city itself is driven by machines that "howls for food". The entire system functions as a consumption mechanism, requiring "living men for food". The workers are reduced to a non-human state, "no longer a man and not yet a machine, pumped dry, hollowed out, used up" by ceaseless, repetitive, and isolating labor. This is a control mechanism based on maximizing industrial efficiency by extinguishing the intellectual and emotional capacities of the worker.

**Engineered Deception and Incitement:** Fredersen seeks **decisions**, not peace. His mechanism for control involves intentionally destabilizing the working class's emotional and social base through calculated deception. The creation of the machine-woman (Parody) in the image of Maria, a "faultless and cool" tool, is explicitly designed to steal Maria's "ego" and incite the masses to riot and destroy their own machines. This engineered chaos ensures that the workers inflict the ruin themselves, achieving the master's political goal through manipulated rage and identification.

### IV. The Escape Vector: Evolution and the Attainment of Will

The single recognized pathway to escape subjugation is through strenuous internal work, aiming not just for knowledge, but for a change in fundamental being.

**The Necessity of Effort and the Path to Will:** Man must achieve self-consciousness, unity, and permanent 'I' to escape his state as a machine. This evolution is not automatic; it requires specific, prolonged efforts within special "schools". The pivotal struggle begins with **self-remembering**—the realization of one's own mechanicalness and the ability to hold attention.

- **Consciousness as Control:** The goal is to acquire command over consciousness, which implies that **consciousness and will are almost one and the same thing**. Consciousness allows the individual to make responses that are deliberate and personal, rather than automatic reactions to the environment.
- **Balance of Being and Knowledge:** True evolution requires the simultaneous growth of both knowledge and being; if knowledge outgrows being, the result is "one-sided development" that fails due to inner contradiction. Achieving Man No. 7 status grants "permanent 'I'" and **free will**, signaling the successful internal control of the self against mechanical impulses.

In essence, control is the default state of man, enforced by his neurological structure, psychological defects, and the demands of organized society. Freedom is an engineered ascent, dependent entirely on acquiring conscious control over the very machine mechanisms designed for external mastery.

## Works Authored by Michael Aquino

These documents, authored by Michael Aquino, provide an overview of his work on **psychological operations ("MindWar") for the U.S. military** and his philosophy and practices within the **Temple of Set**, a group he founded that emerged from the Church of Satan. The text on MindWar proposes a shift in military strategy toward **influencing the enemy's will** through psychological means, even suggesting its application to domestic populations. The Temple of Set material introduces its **beliefs, structure, and magical practices**, contrasting them with conventional religions and other occult traditions, emphasizing the development of the **individual psyche** and a non-natural approach to reality. The writings explore the concept of the soul, different theories of reality, and the practice of **Lesser and Greater Black Magic** as means for self-transformation and influencing the world.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the "Book of Coming Forth by Night" and what is its significance?

:::details Answer
The "Book of Coming Forth by Night" is described as a "simple, beautiful, and purposeful statement from the sentient being whom mankind has loved, hated, worshipped, cursed, praised, and reviled as the Prince of Darkness." Michael Aquino accepted this text in a deliberate and reflective way, resolving to create and care for the Temple of Set based upon its principles. He views the text as having originated from the entity known as Set, the ancient Egyptian deity. The book is considered the foundational text for the Temple of Set, articulating the nature of Set as an independent intelligence operating outside the order of the objective universe and stating that the essence of the psyche is not dependent upon or imprisoned by the material world, but rather uses the physical body as a vehicle for self-awareness and reaching towards conscious existence. The concept of Xeper, defined as this process of self-awareness and becoming, is central to the Temple of Set's philosophy and is presented as originating from this text.
:::

### What is the nature of the Egyptian entity Set according to these sources?

:::details Answer
Set is described as an "ageless Intelligence of this Universe" who created HarWer to define himself. Unlike other gods, who are seen as creations of men, Set's semblance is described as not of Earth. Set is presented as a finite intelligence operating independently of the mechanically consistent objective universe, capable of making distinctions and not favoring any particular component like mankind. Set is also associated with the "Black Flame," described as an essence whose power can effect creation by force of Will. The sources also mention ancient Egyptian worship of Set and his association with strength and rage on the battlefield. The Temple of Set asserts the actual existence of Set, distinct from the Judæo-Christian concept of Satan, and links him to the original, pre-Judæo/Christian entity.
:::

### How does the Temple of Set view the human psyche and its potential?

:::details Answer
According to the "Book of Coming Forth by Night," the essence of the psyche is not dependent upon or imprisoned by the material realm. Instead, the physical body serves as a vehicle through which the psyche can become aware of itself and reach towards the limitlessness of its conscious existence. This process is defined by the Egyptian hieroglyphic term Xeper. "This life" is seen as a "springboard or launching-pad towards the psyche’s ultimate Self-awareness and state of Being." This view contrasts with Abrahamic religions which are characterized as "death cults" that offer nothing in this life in exchange for demanded commitment and abstinence, seeing this life merely as a test or task-fulfilling period. The Temple of Set emphasizes the potential for individual consciousness to transcend the material and achieve a divine state of being.
:::

### What is the concept of "Æon" as discussed in these texts?

:::details Answer
The sources refer to the concept of "æons" in both a "LBM sense" and a "GBM sense." In the "GBM sense," an æon is described as a living entity in which its initiates are "cells." The "god" of an æon is seen as a creature of the total magical and philosophical energy of material beings who are aware they are "components of the god." This concept is linked to the Gnostics and Hegel's idea of an "overmind." The sources also mention the "Æon of Set," with Michael Aquino identifying himself as the "Magus of the Æon of Set," positioned to alter the existing æonic formula. A Magus of an Æon is described as a Master who has "stepped outside" the totality of the existing formula to alter it in an evolutionary way, potentially inaugurating a new Æon or improving the current one.
:::

### How do these sources describe the initiatory degree system within the Church of Satan and the Temple of Set?

:::details Answer
The sources detail a hierarchical degree system, with variations between the Church of Satan and the Temple of Set, and references to older systems like the A.'.A.'. and G.'.D.'. In the Church of Satan, the I° (Satanist) grants membership benefits without reciprocal responsibilities, suitable for those pursuing personal interests. The II° (Witch or Warlock) certifies an individual as an effective and accomplished Satanic magician, considered the highest recognition within a true Satanic order due to the emphasis on individual technique. The Temple of Set has a more extensive system. The III° is considered the most essential distinction, signifying a transition from a human to a divine state of being, sacred to Set. The IV°-VI° have additional attributes but don't equal the III°. The Magus (V° Temple of Set/Church of Satan, (9)=[2] A.'.A.'./G.'.D.'. ) is a master who alters the æonic formula. Higher grades, like Magister Templi ((8)=[3] A.'.A.'./G.'.D.'.), are associated with comprehending the entire objective universe and require an independent and distinct Will.
:::

### What is the significance of the "Black Flame" and "Black Magic"?

:::details Answer
The Black Flame is described as the "essence of [Satan's] own being," possessing the power to effect creation solely through force of Will. This Black Fire, also referred to as Black Magic, is presented as a "key to infinite Will." It is a gift from Hell to man, entrusting him with "perfect freedom" that cannot be recalled. Black Magic is the means by which the Black Magus can defy all constraints and cast down opposition by force of Will alone. However, the Black Magus must conquer his own Will to avoid self-destruction through misuse of this power, as even Satan cannot control the Gift once given. The goal is for the Black Flame to become "Red" in the "perfection of the Will of man," eventually leading to the obliteration of the current Universe to prove mastery and the recreation of the Cosmos by the Red Magus.
:::

### How do the sources contrast the philosophies of the Left-Hand Path (LHP) and Right-Hand Path (RHP)?

:::details Answer
The sources explicitly mention the "Two Initiatory Paths," the Left-Hand Path (LHP) and the Right-Hand Path (RHP). While not fully detailed in the provided excerpts, the context suggests a distinction in their approach to spiritual progression and the nature of the self. The concept of the Magister Templi is presented as an initiatory level attainable only through the Left-Hand Path, described as fraught with continuous peril rather than a single test. The LHP seems to emphasize individual will, separation, and independence from the objective universe. The RHP, as implied by the discussion of Abrahamic religions as "death cults" and the "dilemma of RHP initiation" which involves the distinction of the individual consciousness from "El" (often associated with a singular God), appears to involve a different relationship with a higher power, potentially leading to either defiance or complete absorption.
:::

### What is the role of Egypt and its ancient deities in these philosophies?

:::details Answer
Ancient Egypt and its deities, particularly Set, play a significant role in the belief system presented. The Temple of Set was created following Michael Aquino's experience with the "Book of Coming Forth by Night," which he attributes to Set, the ancient Egyptian deity. The sources discuss the ancient Egyptian pantheon (neteru), their incorporation into regional and national groups, and the elevation of specific deities based on cult centers and dynasties. Specific Egyptian concepts and terms are integrated into the philosophy, such as Xeper (self-awareness/becoming), Ba and Ka (aspects of the soul/psyche), Ren (Name), and Sekhem (power/energy). The texts draw parallels between ancient Egyptian practices and the philosophical concepts discussed, suggesting a historical lineage or inspiration from Egyptian beliefs, particularly those related to the nature of the soul, magic, and deities like Set, Ra, and Hathor.

## **Briefing Document: Michael A. Aquino - Military Officer and Occultist**

### Background and Military Career

Michael A. Aquino's professional background includes a military career in the United States Army Reserve. He held the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in Military Intelligence, USAR-Ret. In 1980, while serving as Major Michael A. Aquino, he was the PSYOP Research & Analysis (R/A) Team Leader at the Headquarters, 7th Psychological Operations Group, United States Army Reserve, located at the Presidio of San Francisco, California.

In this capacity, Colonel Paul E. Vallely, Commander of the 7th PSYOP Group, asked Major Aquino to draft a paper encouraging future thought within the PSYOP community, focusing on innovative ideas concerning PSYOP's evolution and application, rather than a postmortem of the Vietnam War. The result of this collaboration, after initial drafts, reviews, and revisions, was the paper "From PSYOP to MindWar: The Psychology of Victory". This paper was intended as a "talking paper" to stimulate dialogue within various governmental offices, agencies, commands, and publications interested in PSYOP.

Aquino's military decorations included the Bronze Star, Meritorious Service Medal, Air Medal, Army Commendation Medal (3 awards), Special Forces Tab, Parachutist Badge, USAF Space & Missile Badge, and various Republic of Vietnam medals, including the Psychological Warfare Medal (First Class). His academic credentials included a B.A. and M.A., and he attended several military schools including the US Army Command & General Staff College, US Army Intelligence School, and the US Army Space Institute.

### Involvement in Occultism and Satanism

The sources detail Michael Aquino's deep involvement in occultism, particularly within the context of Satanism and the Temple of Set, which he founded.

#### Church of Satan

Prior to founding the Temple of Set, Michael Aquino was involved with the Church of Satan, founded by Anton Szandor LaVey in 1966. He was the only member of the Church of Satan to attain the degree of Magister Templi IV° prior to 1975. He was also a member of the Church's Council of Nine and Order of the Trapezoid from 1970-75. Aquino served as Editor of the Church’s Cloven Hoof newsletter from 1971-75.

Aquino describes the Church of Satan as being "thrown together in improvised haste from a variety of vaguely- or un-related concepts" and used to transport its members on a "soaring, plunging, and haphazard journey". He notes that Anton LaVey published "The Satanic Bible" in 1970 to summarize the basic tenets of his philosophy. This philosophy initially did not represent Satan and dæmons as actual "supernatural" beings, but rather as symbols and metaphors for "hedonistic self-indulgence". However, the book also promised results from simplified magical rituals invoking Satan and other entities, creating an inconsistency between professed "psychodramatic atheism" and assuming the "literal existence of dæmonic personages".

According to Aquino, the Church of Satan became more of an impersonal institution united by common beliefs as it expanded beyond San Francisco, behaving more like a nonprofit organization focused on Satan. This contrasted with its origins as largely a personal vehicle for LaVey's advertisement and profit.

#### Founding the Temple of Set

By early 1975, tensions and dilemmas within the Church of Satan reached a boiling point. These tensions included:

1. Whether the Church was theistic (believing in actual entities like Satan) or atheistic (using them as symbols).
2. The possibility of a "two-tiered" attitude where the leadership privately believed in literal entities while presenting an atheistic satire to the public.
3. The transition from a personal vehicle for LaVey to a more impersonal institution united by common beliefs.

These factors culminated in Anton LaVey's "Phase IV" policy paper, which weakened the formal standing of non-entourage officials and groups, returning influence to LaVey's sole decision. LaVey also attempted to "destroy the independent significance and structure of the Church’s initiatory degree system" by making degree definition and bestowal his personal whim.

In response to these actions, Michael Aquino wrote letters in June 1975 rejecting what he saw as a "critical corruption" of the Church of Satan and announcing his disavowal of the organization controlled by the LaVeys. Many other Satanists also resigned. Aquino felt looked to provide an alternative, although he initially felt "ill-qualified and ill-disposed". He had regarded the Church as "metaphysically sacred" and LaVey as the "anointed personal deputy of Satan himself".

Aquino began considering a "reformed Church of Satan," which he referred to as a "Second Church of Satan". The central question was whether Satan would transfer authority to a successor Church.

##### The North Solstice X Working and the Book of Coming Forth by Night

Seeking guidance, Aquino felt the need to appeal to Satan himself. He chose the night of June 21-22, 1975, the Summer Solstice and anniversary of his ordination to the Priesthood. He performed a Greater Black Magic (GBM) working alone, which resulted in him writing down "The Book of Coming Forth by Night" over about four hours.

Aquino describes this experience as neither dictation nor automatic writing, but thoughts, words, and phrases that seemed indistinct from his own, yet impressed him as unique and necessary, as if "something beyond Michael Aquino was generating it". He had a sensation and conviction that it was authentic, a communication from the Egyptian god Set, and that he must take it wholly and sincerely to heart.

"The Book of Coming Forth by Night" became the "founding authority and philosophical cornerstone" of the Temple of Set. It marked a "final, dignified terminus" for the Church of Satan, superseding it with the Temple of Set. The Temple of Set was organized, incorporated, and recognized nationally as a tax-exempt religious institution within four months of the working.

### The Temple of Set: Core Concepts and Philosophy

The Temple of Set is presented as a new initiatory institution rooted in the philosophy revealed through "The Book of Coming Forth by Night" and further developed in subsequent texts.

#### Set and the Æon of Set

The "Book of Coming Forth by Night" is presented as a communication from the Egyptian god Set. The text proclaims a new "Æon," the "Æon of Set". The name "Set" is explicitly chosen to replace the "bastard title" of "Satan," identified as a Hebrew title ("Adversary"). The Temple uses the name with a hard "-t," following "The Book of Coming Forth by Night" and the hieroglyphic pronunciation.

The ancient Egyptian neteru (gods) are not seen merely as "supernatural persons" or anthropomorphic figures, but as representing "various aspects of existence" or "Forms" / "First Principles". Set represents the non-natural "presence of self" in individual intelligent life, an existence known by the "shadow it casts on things apprehended and things perceived by it," distinct from perceptions of the natural senses. Set is described as the "conceptualizer" and "designer" of the principle of the "awareness of self".

The "Book of Coming Forth by Night" refers to Set as the "Prince of Darkness". Those who call him this do him no dishonor. Set is described as the "Highest of Life," in majesty greater than the forces of the Universe. He is the one who fashioned human intelligence as his own, enlightened the desire for perfection and truth, and enshrined the Will to Come Into Being in humanity. He is the true origin of "Liber AL" (Aleister Crowley's Book of the Law) and remained hidden until the North Solstice of X (1975 CE).

The Æon of Set is characterized by the philosophy summarized by the Word "Xeper". The Formula of the Æon of Set is XXX = Xepera Xeper Xeperu = "I Have Come Into Being and Created That Which Has Come Into Being". This refers to the transformation and evolution of the Will from a human to a divine state of being through deliberate, conscious, individual force of mind. Setians are guardians of this Æon, called by Set because they are zealous in what they do.

#### The Psyche, Soul, and MindStar

The concept of the conscious self, distinct from the objective universe, is central to Setian philosophy. The sources discuss this concept using various terms. The awareness of self is identified as the "ba" by ancient Egyptians, the "psyche" by Greeks, and the "soul" in modern language. More precision is sought by subtracting the "life force" from the psyche and focusing on the "awareness of self". This mirrors Descartes' "cogito ergo sum" but views this phenomenon as a "thing totally apart," not an extension of God.

The concept of the "soul" is further elaborated as the "MindStar," described as an eight-emanation schematic of individual immortality from Egyptian metaphysics. These emanations are:

1. **Khat:** The body-emanation, integral with the physical body, the source of the "energy double". It is what non-Initiates imagine as the entire soul that is reincarnated.
2. **Ren:** The name-emanation, representing the power of names to identify, define, protect, and empower individuals. It is through names that neteru can take form and voice.
3. **Khabit:** The shadow-emanation, the connection of the incarnate khat with the life-forces of the natural neteru, functioning as the individual "life-field". In Black Magic, it can be sent out as an instrument of influence. After death, it becomes an avatar of Anubis, guiding the non-initiate consciousness.
4. **Ab:** The heart-emanation, the physical locus of individual identity and consciousness. It is the bridge between the Objective and Subjective Universes.
5. **Ba:** The soul-emanation, described as the immortal nucleus of self-consciousness, capable of transcending space and time. It is the locus of the immortal self-consciousness and exists independent of the physical body. Lifting the ba to a higher level of awareness is part of the Temple's curriculum.
6. **Ka:** The astral-double emanation, an eternal, distinct, and otherness-separate entity. It remains immortally finite. The magician can construct a "magical double" or ka within their subjective universe and transfer their ba to it for a GBM working.
7. **Sekhem:** The neter-emanation, representing power emanating from the neteru themselves, "the power of the stars" through which neteru manifest in the Objective Universe. It combines with the ab to draw the essence of adored neteru into consciousness. Each incidence of sekhem activation infuses the Initiate with more of the invoked neter.
8. **Akh:** The ghost-emanation, the highest emanation of the MindStar, described as the illuminated, eternal, immortal spirit. It is the infinite radiance of one's MindStar.

Activating the MindStar is the ability to Come Into Being (Xeper).

#### Objective and Subjective Universes

Setian philosophy distinguishes between the Objective Universe (OU) and the Subjective Universe(s) (SU).

- **Objective Universe (OU):** The single, collectively-experienced environment of matter and energy external to each individual consciousness. It is described as the creation and manifestation of the neteru. It has four dimensions: length, width, depth, and duration (time).
- **Subjective Universe (SU):** Individual universe(s) that exist externally to the OU for each soul. The Subjective Universe of the magician and/or others is not controlled by the laws of the objective universe.

Greater Black Magic involves causing change in the subjective universe, which _may_ cause a similar and proportionate change in the objective universe via the "Magical Link" phenomenon.

#### Left-Hand Path (LHP) and Right-Hand Path (RHP)

The Temple of Set identifies with the Left-Hand Path (LHP). The sources define the Two Paths:

- **Right-Hand Path (RHP):** Those whose goal is "egocentric merger with the objective universe" or "reacceptance by and reabsorption into the universal, divine consciousness of El". They seek to harmonize with the objective universe and attain immortality by becoming part of Universal Consciousness. This involves the "obliteration of the 'original sin' separate self". RHP initiation is described as leading to continuous relaxation and harmony. AMORC is analyzed as a contemporary RHP organization.
- **Left-Hand Path (LHP):** The path whose object is to "strengthen and exalt the psychecentric consciousness as something distinct from the objective universe". It is an avenue towards knowledge and power. The LHP teaches that the objective and subjective universes are distinct due to the principle of isolate consciousness. Cultivating this intelligence allows one to Xeper (Come Into Being) and leads to "individually-determined freedom". The LHP is described as a condition of continuous stress.

While the Temple of Set is an LHP institution, Aquino explored contemporary RHP initiation (specifically AMORC) to see if it offered a viable alternative for the majority of humans for whom Setian initiation is too dangerous. He concluded that LHP initiation is suitable for only a "very few" due to its psychological stress. The challenge presented in "IlluminAnX" is to discover a "dignified and fulfilling metaphysical philosophy for the many for whom LHP initiation is not an attainable, comfortable, or safe option".

#### Black Magic: Lesser, Medial, and Greater

The Temple of Set's philosophy includes different types of Black Magic.

- **Lesser Black Magic (LBM):** Influencing beings, processes, or objects in the objective universe by applying "obscure physical or behavioral laws". It is an "impelling" (encouraging, increasing probability) measure, not a "compelling" (forcing) one. It involves manipulating psychological factors and social dynamics, often without the subject's conscious awareness. Examples include applying political and propaganda techniques on a mass scale. LBM should not be used on other Setians. It is dangerous because it can tempt the individual to unethical abuse.
- **Medial Black Magic (MBM):** A simplified, directed application of Greater Black Magic towards solving problems or adjusting situations in the objective universe. It bridges the gap between GBM and LBM, using metaphysical means (the Magical Link) for goals similar to LBM, but it is not as "pure" as true GBM. It is simple and direct, requiring only as much formality as feels appropriate.
- **Greater Black Magic (GBM):** Causing change in the subjective universe according to the will. This change _may_ cause a similar and proportionate change in the objective universe. It involves altering one's subjective frame of reference. GBM is difficult to conceptualize, master theoretically, and practice reliably. It is a supra-rational experience. GBM is dangerous because its practice "makes possible the destruction of the perspectives of the rational consciousness". A GBM working involves constructing an artificial environment (ritual chamber) aligned with the concept one intends to focus on, engaging all five physical senses. It involves creating a "magical double" or ka in the subjective universe, transferring the ba to it, and executing one's will in the subjective universe. Workings can be illustrative (understanding something) or operative (changing something). Ideally, one should not use GBM when MBM will suffice, nor MBM when LBM will suffice, nor LBM when conventional actions will suffice.

#### Initiation and Degrees

Initiation in the Temple of Set is not simply joining a secret society or acquiring knowledge/skills; it is a "certain approach to the challenges of existence" and involves the "acquired and applied technique of 'stepping back to view the situation from outside himself'". It is conceived as a Socratic refutation of confused information and thinking, the imparting of truth, and the ability to pursue and recognize truth. Initiation is something individuals do for themselves; the Temple aids this personal initiation.

The Temple uses a system of "Recognizing" degrees, reflecting an individual's position at a point in time based on their achieved level of wisdom and skill, rather than "awarding" degrees for specific knowledge or passing tests. There are no penalties for revealing "esoteric secrets".

The degree structure dates back to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and Aleister Crowley's Astrum Argentum (A.'.A.'.), adapted by the Church of Satan and subsequently by the Temple of Set.

The degrees of the Temple of Set are:

- **Setian I°:** The entry-level degree. Individuals may join directly at this level. The Temple's information and resources are available, and the Setian is expected to take the initiative to become an Adept. There is a time limit of two years for this degree.
- **Adept II°:** Recognized by the Temple as a competent Black Magician. This signifies the "licensing" of the recipient to practice the Art knowledgeably, ethically, and professionally. The transition from I° to II° is seen as corresponding broadly to the transition from (1)= to (7)= in the A.'.A.'. system, representing the strengthening of the purely human mind to its maximum potential. Evaluation for this degree is done by III°+ officials and is not based on standardized criteria.
- **Priest or Priestess III°:** The most essential and significant distinction recognized by the degree system. It identifies a transition from a human state of being to that of a divine being, ordained by and sacred to Set. It involves the "merging of the consciousness, indeed the personality, with that of the Prince of Darkness himself". The Priest/Priestess becomes a "veritable living Temple indwelled by the presence of Set" when acting as such. They are chosen by the "Powers of Darkness," not other humans. This concept is contrasted with conventional priesthoods. Recognition is performed by IV° officials.
- **Master IV°:** Characterized by additional attributes beyond the III°. The Magistry constitutes an expansion of the merger with Set's consciousness to a "full apprehension of the Æon of Set". The Master understands Set's consciousness and its reach, evaluating phenomena within the continuum of the Æon. Adjustments made by a Master are for Æonic purposes. Masters are first and foremost Initiates of the Priesthood with a distinguished record. Recognition requires confirmation from the Council of Nine.
- **Magus V°:** The highest degree conferred within the authority of the Mandate (in the Church of Satan). In the Temple of Set, it is characterized by certain additional attributes beyond the III°. The essential characteristic of a Magus is the manifestation of a philosophical principle or "utterance of a Word" to supersede or enhance previous ways of understanding. The Magus has achieved a perspective of separation from the objective universe and from that viewpoint, Utters a Word to alter that universe. Crowley is cited as a model for this level. The Curse of a Magus is that he is not Understood initially because he promulgates something alien to existing philosophy.
- **Ipsissimus VI°:** The highest degree, beyond comprehension of those of lower degrees. Characterized by certain additional attributes beyond the III°. An Ipsissimus is essentially a "successful Magus" whose Task is complete. The doom of an Ipsissimus is to Understand many æons simultaneously, seeing how they can be exclusive yet complementary.

Degrees beyond the III° are difficult to describe without specialized terminology. The Initiate of any Priesthood degree (III°-VI°) can function at a lower degree. Abuse of the degree system is cited as a cause of damage to the Temple and individuals. All medallions, I° to VI°, are identical save in background color, symbolizing that no Setian is "better" by degree, only more experienced on certain paths.

#### The Pentagram of Set

The Temple of Set uses the pentagram as a significant symbol. Archaeological data is presented suggesting the pentagram was known in ancient Egypt as early as the Fourth Dynasty and used on pottery. It was found on pottery in graves, suggesting it predates or arises from traditions outside the strict artistic canons and religious formulæ of pharaonic Egypt. The five-pointed star is found everywhere in Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions and art, but never six-pointed stars or hexagrams. A seven-pointed star is the symbol of Seshet.

The "secret" of the pentagram is that its lines reflect the Golden Mean (Phi, Φ). Every line segment divided by the next shorter segment yields Phi (approximately 1.618). Occult authorities historically overlooked this, using "magic pentangles" with Cabalistic additions, which were unconscious efforts to use the innate power of the pentagram without recognizing its true nature. The Temple of Set uses the pentagram in its pure form, keeping the beauty of Phi undiluted.

The Pentagram of Set is cast in silver, the traditional color of night, in recognition of Set as Prince of Darkness and counterpart to the Horus light of day. Silver also signifies initiatory and exclusive religious systems. The background color of the medallion varies by degree:

- **I°:** White, symbolizing freedom from myths and misconceptions based on fear and superstition.
- **II°:** Red, not explicitly defined in source.
- **III°:** Silver, not explicitly defined in source.
- **IV°:** Blue, not explicitly defined in source.
- **V°:** Purple, the traditional color of royalty, signifying the Magus is Tasked by the Prince of Darkness with the Utterance of a Word.
- **VI°:** Gold, the symbolism of which is known to Masters of the Temple.
- **Honorary Setian:** Green background (natural universe) with a gold pentagram (non-initiatory).

The Church of Satan used the Sigil of Baphomet, an inverse pentagram with a goat's head surrounded by Hebrew letters for Leviathan. This was a corruption of the pentagram's essence, dimmed by a Moorish name ("Baphomet"), Hebrew letters, and the goat of Mendes. Set allowed this "curious corruption" during the Age of Satan to honor how he was perceived then, but desired his pentagram to be pure again in his Æon.

#### Council of Nine

The Council of Nine are the highest officials of the Temple of Set and Guardians of the Æon. Their emblem is the sacred Tcham sceptre. They carry forward the tradition and name of the Nine Unknown, which was the basis for the Church of Satan's Council of Nine. The legend of the Nine Unknown originated with Emperor Asoka of India (3rd century BCE), who selected nine sages to form a secret protective society. The High Priest of Set determines Temple policy and operations but is responsible to the Nine.

### Key Texts and Workings

Several texts and magical workings are central to Michael Aquino's work and the Temple of Set.

- **From PSYOP to MindWar:** A paper drafted by Major Aquino and Colonel Vallely in 1980 to stimulate future thought in the US Army PSYOP community. It proposes "MindWar" as a strategic approach, moving beyond traditional "leaflet and loudspeaker" PSYOP to influencing the minds of national populations through mass media. MindWar aims to strengthen one's own national will and attack the enemy's, ideally before combat begins. It emphasizes that wars are won or lost "in the minds of men". The paper suggests MindWar must originate at the national level and be preeminent in the commander's strategy. It posits that MindWar must always speak the truth, unlike propaganda assumed to be lies. MindWar involves using communication media skillfully. It seeks to influence audiences' intense emotions and commitments, requiring rigorous principles of truth and ethics; otherwise, the "disintoxication" can be socially shattering. Aquino notes that MindWar's implementation may be resisted by the "military/industrial complex" as the only losers are war profiteers. He observed its prescriptions applied in the Gulf War and 2003 invasion of Iraq, including embedding journalists, which created a psychological climate accelerating victory, although the failure to adhere to truth and ethics led to a post-victory evaporation of that climate. The paper also controversially suggests that MindWar could potentially leverage natural phenomena like atmospheric electromagnetic activity, air ionization, and extremely low frequency (ELF) waves to influence target receptiveness, drawing comparisons to fields like "psychotronics" but distinguishing itself from them. It notes the legal prohibition against US PSYOP units targeting American citizens, based on the presumption that propaganda is misleading and the government shouldn't lie to its people. MindWar, by speaking truth, supposedly circumvents this.
- **The Diabolicon:** Written by Aquino in 1970 while stationed in Vietnam. Described as a restatement of themes from John Milton's "Paradise Lost". It is presented as a communication from Satan Archdaemon and other entities (Beelzebub, Asmodeus, Belial, Leviathan). The text asserts that "God" is evil and "Satan," as a repudiation of that evil, is truly good. It defines "evil" as human denial of personal responsibility and hypocrisy, and "goodness" as genuine personal responsibility and acceptance of consequences. It speaks of Satan giving a "Gift" (intelligence, will) to mankind, which Michael and other archangels feared would lead to Armageddon. Michael vows to guide men towards "blissful refuge" while Satan (taking the name Satan ArchDaemon, enemy of God) determines man will recognize and reject the "living death" God offers. The Gift of Hell is pure and true omnipotence in man's hands, enabling him to aspire to mastery of Universal existence. The Diabolicon details how various Daemons tutor man: Asmodeus in recognition, comparison, science, and judgment; Belial in the Black Magic (Black Flame).
- **The Book of Coming Forth by Night:** The record of the North Solstice X Working (June 21-22, 1975) which founded the Temple of Set. It is presented as a communication from the Egyptian god Set. The title is described as a negation of the Egyptian "Book of the Dead" (Book of Coming Forth by Day). It declares the end of the Æon of Horus and the intermediary Age of Satan, ushering in the Æon of Set. It charges the founding of a Temple of Set to replace the Church of Satan. The text uses precise or unique language requiring careful consideration. It calls for Setians to shun recitation and speak to Set as a friend, at night. It refers to the "Word of Set" and critiques the "feeble and corrupt Keys of Enoch".
- **The Word of Set:** A text in nineteen parts, originally transcribed by Aquino around June 1-20, 1975, and completed on April 13, 1981. It is presented as a "remote corruption" of the Enochian Keys, translated into English. It is described as idiomatic, not word-for-word. The Working on the Word of Set aimed to present the Enochian Keys in a "still 'Blacker' version" than LaVey's. The nineteen Parts address various concepts related to Set, the orderings of life, threats from the worship of death, and calls to the Elect.
- **Jeweled Tablets of Set:** A series of volumes described as a sort of "encyclopædia" of Setian initiation, reflecting the progressive degrees. Volumes include the Crystal Tablet (I°/introductory, containing "Black Magic"), Ruby Tablet (II° Adepts), Onyx Tablet (III° Priesthood), Sapphire Tablet (IV° Masters), Amethyst Tablet (V° Magi), and Topaz Tablet (VI° Ipsissimi).
- **"Black Magic":** The introductory section in the Crystal Tablet of Set. It discusses the theory and practice of Black Magic (Lesser, Medial, Greater) and its ethical dimensions within Setian philosophy. It contrasts Setian ethics with conventional religious and social contract theories. It emphasizes the need for initiates to develop their own ethics independent of imposed norms.
- **"The Sphinx and the Chimæra":** A Greater Black Magic working recorded and annotated by Aquino on May 30, 1975. It involved evoking a sphinx and a chimæra to explore magical implications of Plato's Dialogues, particularly "The Sophist" and "The Statesman". The working examines Plato's arguments, concepts of Forms/neteru, and the limitations of logic in apprehending metaphysical truth. It connects Platonic philosophy to Egyptian metaphysics and Pythagorean doctrines.

### Controversies and Challenges

Aquino's work has faced controversy. The "MindWar" paper, with its "sinister" title, quickly gained a "lurid, conspiracy-theory reputation," with rumors transforming it into an "Orwellian blueprint for Manchurian Candidate mind control and world domination". Aquino's public image as an "occult personality" fueled this, leading to claims that the Pentagon was involved in "Black Magic and Devil-worship". Aquino dismisses this as an "absurdly comic opera".

The Temple of Set itself faced a decade of "Satanic conspiracy" hysteria in the United States during the 1980s. Aquino and his wife Lilith were targeted in the Presidio "Satanic abuse" scam. This period led to increased persecution against the Temple, including harassment and violence.

In "IlluminAnX," Aquino recounts his experience joining AMORC (Ancient and Mystical Order Rosæ Crucis) to investigate RHP initiation as an alternative for those unsuited to the LHP. His membership was ultimately terminated by the AMORC Board of Directors for "conduct materially and seriously prejudicial to AMORC's interests and purposes". This conduct was specified as an eight-page online forum post discussing Egyptian concepts of immortality (the MindStar) as an alternative to AMORC's Hindu-reincarnation doctrine. Aquino asserts that the AMORC Grand Mistress "could not endure even the possibility that AMORC doctrine concerning El-monotheism and Hindu-reincarnation is factually false," leading to his expulsion. He concludes that AMORC's claim of "religious tolerance" and its Temple membership are meaningless.

The sources also discuss the psychological dangers of initiation. Strengthening consciousness, particularly for those unprepared, can evoke "monsters of the id" capable of psychological harm. The stress of LHP initiation increases with higher levels. The Temple endeavors to dissuade unsuitable personalities from seeking initiation or to intervene if an effort is "miscarrying in ominous directions".

### Conclusion

Based on the provided sources, Michael A. Aquino is presented as a figure with a dual career in both the US military psychological operations and the leadership of a unique occult organization, the Temple of Set. His writings detail a complex philosophical system drawing heavily on ancient Egyptian religion, distinguishing itself from traditional Satanism and other occult paths. Key concepts include the nature of the self (MindStar), the distinction between objective and subjective realities, the pursuit of individual becoming (Xeper), and different forms of magic. His work and the Temple of Set have navigated significant controversies and challenges, including public hysteria and internal philosophical conflicts.

## Additional Questions

### _Discuss the implications of Michael Aquino's Satanic world view with his work in the US Military in Psychological Operations_

Based on the sources provided, we can discuss the potential implications of Michael Aquino's Satanic or, more specifically, Setian worldview on his work and concepts in U.S. Military Psychological Operations (PSYOP), particularly as articulated in the "From PSYOP to MindWar" paper. Michael Aquino held positions in both realms: he was a Lieutenant Colonel in Military Intelligence, U.S. Army Reserve-Ret., with a background in Psychological Operations, and a prominent figure in the Temple of Set, having been its founding High Priest and recognized as an Ipsissimus VI°. He was also a co-author of the "From PSYOP to MindWar: The Psychology of Victory" paper.

The "From PSYOP to MindWar" paper, co-authored by Colonel Paul E. Vallely and Major Michael A. Aquino in 1980, proposed a significant evolution in military strategy. It argued that traditional PSYOP was often relegated to a secondary role as a "force multiplier," brought in only after principal strategic decisions were made based on conventional political and military interests. MindWar, as envisioned in the paper, would reverse this sequence, becoming the primary strategy, with psychological means designed to achieve victory by convincing the enemy to align their national policies with U.S. interests. Ordinary military force would be a last resort. The paper advocated using mass electronic media, such as television and radio, to reach global populations. MindWar was to be strategic, targeting enemy nations and also strengthening the United States by denying enemy propaganda access to its people and explaining the rationale for U.S. actions. An essential tenet of MindWar, as stated in the paper, was that it must always speak the truth, distinguishing it from propaganda, which is often perceived as lies or distortions. However, a later annotation by Aquino on the paper notes that the failure of MindWar techniques used in instances like the 2003 invasion of Iraq to adhere to "rigorous principles of truth and ethics" led to a post-victory "disintoxication".

Simultaneously, Michael Aquino's Setian philosophy, as described in sources like "Black Magic," centers on the concept of the psyche, which is seen as distinct from the material body and not merely a product of natural forces. The core tenet of Setian initiation is the pursuit of "Xeper" (pronounced "kheffer," meaning "to Become" or "Come Into Being"), which is the process of the psyche becoming aware of itself and reaching towards limitless conscious existence. This is part of the Left-Hand Path (LHP), which aims to strengthen and exalt the psychecentric consciousness as something distinct from the objective universe, in contrast to the Right-Hand Path (RHP) which seeks merger with a universal consciousness or objective reality. Setianism views conventional religions as often inadequate, based on passive adherence, indoctrination, and potentially self-deception, rather than active, rational understanding and personal experience.

Within the Setian framework, magic is categorized into Lesser Black Magic (LBM) and Greater Black Magic (GBM). LBM involves influencing the objective universe by manipulating obscure physical or behavioral laws. It can be applied to mass situations like politics and propaganda, controlling people without their realizing how or why. The practitioner of LBM is described not as a crude predator, but an "adjustor, a manipulator, a meta-physician," using the art for the satisfaction derived from exercising wisdom. GBM, on the other hand, is the causing of change in the subjective universe in accordance with the will, which may then cause a similar change in the objective universe via the Magical Link. GBM involves exploring and adjusting subjective realities, understanding that people perceive the objective universe through "subjective overlays". Ethics in Black Magic are presented as complex, depending on cultural context and the intended results, rather than rigid good/evil formulas. The Black Magician must understand the ethical components particular to a culture to be effective. The misuse of LBM can lead to unethical abuse, while careless use of GBM can lead to psychological damage.

Considering these elements, several implications arise when overlaying Aquino's Setian perspective onto the concept of MindWar:

1. **Goal of Psychological Influence:** Both MindWar and Black Magic share the fundamental goal of influencing minds and behavior, potentially on a mass scale. MindWar aims to change enemy minds and shape public perception to achieve strategic victory, while LBM is explicitly described as a technique for influencing human disposition and behavior in mass situations like politics and propaganda. The objective of convincing the enemy "that he really wants to bring his national policies into harmony with ours" aligns with the Black Magic goal of applying knowledge to influence entities and events in the objective universe according to one's will.
2. **Methods and Media:** MindWar proposes the extensive use of mass media, especially electronic media like television and radio, to achieve its goals. This directly corresponds to the LBM application of propaganda in mass situations to impel behavior at a subconscious level. The Black Magician aims to manipulate obscure tendencies in onlookers' behavior. The MindWar approach of using media to shape a "psychological climate of inexorable U.S. victory" resonates with the LBM understanding that propaganda can create subjective overlays that make it difficult to perceive reality without the subjectively-imposed interpretation.
3. **Understanding the Target Audience:** Effective MindWar requires "mapping the minds" of target populations. Similarly, effective Black Magic involves investigating conscious and subconscious factors governing a subject's behavior and understanding cultural mind-sets. The Black Magician is interested in behavior determinants that are obscure and consciously unknown to the subject, which could inform the methods used in MindWar.
4. **Ethics and "Truth":** The MindWar paper states that MindWar must always speak the truth, contrasting it with traditional propaganda. However, the later annotation notes that real-world application has fallen short of this ideal, leading to negative consequences. The Setian view on ethics in Black Magic is more pragmatic, emphasizing that ethical neutrality of the act itself and judging results based on various cultural and desired outcomes. The warning about "disintoxication" in MindWar if ethical values are not respected or if used for "ulterior motives" could be interpreted through the lens of LBM ethics, where unintended negative consequences can arise from ignorance, immaturity, or impulsiveness. The failure of the "Magical Link" in MBM might work in unexpected ways or not at all if the "distortion" attempted is too great relative to the energy applied and other factors.
5. **Expertise and Control:** While Setianism emphasizes individual initiation and is explicitly not for the masses, MindWar requires specialized teams of full-time experts, suggesting an elite group of operators responsible for its execution, even if the target is widespread. The Black Magician similarly achieves competence through study, experimentation, and seeking advice from the Priesthood. Both imply the need for skilled individuals to wield powerful tools or techniques.
6. **Emphasis on Non-Physical Means:** MindWar prioritizes psychological means over physical force, aligning with the various forms of Black Magic (LBM, GBM, MBM) which focus on influencing the subjective and objective universes through non-physical means, or as an enhancement to ordinary techniques.

In essence, Aquino's Setian worldview provides a philosophical and practical framework for understanding and applying techniques aimed at influencing consciousness and behavior, both individually and on a mass scale, through means beyond conventional physical interaction. The concepts of LBM, the manipulation of subjective overlays, and a results-oriented approach to ethics offer a potential theoretical underpinning for the aggressive, media-driven psychological strategy proposed in "From PSYOP to MindWar." While the military paper emphasizes "truth," the broader Setian perspective on magic and propaganda suggests an awareness that perceptions (subjective universes) can be shaped and manipulated, and that effectiveness often lies in influencing subconscious factors that the target may not even perceive. The noted failures in applying MindWar ethically in practice might, from a Black Magic standpoint, be seen as a consequence of inadequate understanding or application of the principles of influencing complex systems, rather than merely a moral failing.

### _How did Michael Aquino apply Setian principals to military strategy?_

Based on the provided sources and our conversation history, Michael Aquino's work in U.S. Military Psychological Operations (PSYOP), particularly his role in co-authoring the "From PSYOP to MindWar" paper, can be discussed in light of his Setian worldview. Aquino was a Lieutenant Colonel in Military Intelligence, U.S. Army Reserve-Ret., with expertise in Psychological Operations. He was also the founding High Priest of the Temple of Set and recognized as an Ipsissimus VI°. His writings on Setianism, such as "Black Magic" and "The Onyx Tablet of Set," describe a philosophy centered on the development of the individual psyche and the application of magical principles to influence reality.

Here's a discussion of the potential implications of Aquino's Setian worldview on his concepts of military psychological operations:

#### **1. The Goal of Psychological Influence: Strategic Victory vs. Affecting Will**

The "From PSYOP to MindWar" paper advocates for a significant shift in military strategy, making psychological means primary over conventional force. The goal is to achieve victory by convincing the enemy "that he really wants to bring his national policies into harmony with ours", essentially changing their will and perception.

Within Aquino's Setian philosophy, magic, specifically Lesser Black Magic (LBM), is defined as influencing the objective universe by manipulating obscure physical or behavioral laws. LBM is explicitly applied to mass situations like politics and propaganda, aiming to control people without them realizing how or why. The adept LBM practitioner is described as an "adjustor, a manipulator, a meta-physician" using their art for the satisfaction of exercising wisdom. This goal of influencing the objective universe and human behavior according to one's will aligns conceptually with MindWar's aim to alter an enemy nation's policies and perceptions to align with U.S. interests.

#### **2. Methods of Influence: Mass Media and Subtle Manipulation**

MindWar proposes utilizing mass electronic media, such as television and radio, for global reach to achieve psychological objectives. This is seen as a tool with the capability "to reach virtually all people on the face of the Earth" and create a "psychological climate of inexorable U.S. victory".

This approach has direct parallels in the description of LBM, which is applied to propaganda in mass situations to "impel behavior at the subconscious level, to control people without their realizing how or why they are being controlled". Propaganda, in this context, is the use of political techniques for behavior-control objectives. The Black Magician investigates conscious and subconscious factors governing behavior, akin to MindWar's need to "map the minds" of target populations.

Furthermore, the MindWar paper mentions utilizing "natural conditions" like atmospheric electromagnetic activity, air ionization, and extremely low frequency (ELF) waves to make minds more receptive to ideas. These are described as naturally-occurring conditions, but their proposed use in MindWar aligns with LBM's manipulation of "obscure physical or behavioral laws" – influencing people through factors they are generally unaware of.

#### **3. Ethics and "Truth": Pragmatism vs. Idealism**

The "From PSYOP to MindWar" paper famously asserts that MindWar "must always speak the truth", contrasting it with traditional propaganda, which is assumed to be lies or distortions. However, Aquino's later annotation in 2003 points out that the failure to adhere to "rigorous principles of truth and ethics" in real-world applications (like the 2003 Iraq invasion) led to negative consequences, a "disintoxication". He stresses the need for MindWar's subordination to "the strictest and most enlightened principles of humanity".

In "Black Magic," the Setian view on ethics in magic is more nuanced and pragmatic. Ethics are presented as complex, dependent on the cultural context and the intended results rather than rigid good/evil formulas. A magical act is considered ethically neutral in itself; "it is the result it produces which will be judged". Effectiveness in LBM requires understanding the ethical components particular to a culture. The warning about the "disintoxication" and social shattering resulting from unethical MindWar use could be interpreted through the Setian understanding that the misuse of LBM can lead to "unethical abuse" or unintended negative consequences if the practitioner lacks the necessary wisdom or understanding of the system. The Setian view acknowledges that influencing complex systems can have unpredictable outcomes, and results are judged by various criteria.

#### **4. The Role of Will and Individual Distinction**

Setian philosophy emphasizes the development and strengthening of the individual psyche and Will ("Xeper") as something distinct from the objective universe. The mythological narrative in _The Diabolicon_ portrays Set (Satan) as the entity who brought Will and intelligence to angels and man, contesting the stasis of God's absolute order. Man is seen as the "child of imbalance" who shall use his Will and empirical conception to create his own order, transcending external imposition. Set gives of his essence to the Elect to strengthen their Will.

MindWar, in a military context, seeks to influence and overcome the _will_ of the enemy. The concept of attacking the enemy's will in their homes and communities where they are vulnerable resonates with the idea of influencing the individual and collective consciousness. While MindWar aims to align enemy will with U.S. interests, the underlying Setian principle emphasizes the power and importance of Will itself and the ability to create one's own order. This philosophical emphasis on Will could inform the strategic prioritization of psychological warfare designed to directly target the enemy's volition.

#### **5. Elite Knowledge and Application**

Setianism is described as being for the "Elect," those with the intellectual and metaphysical capacity for initiation, not the masses. Mastery of magical arts requires study, experimentation, and guidance from the Priesthood. The Temple of Set is described as an "intellectual discipline or school of thought" for those who seek to develop their magical abilities.

Similarly, the MindWar paper argues for the creation of specialized "MindWar teams" composed of "full-time experts" who can translate national strategy into tactical goals. This suggests an understanding that effective psychological operations at a strategic level require skilled individuals with deep expertise, mirroring the Setian concept of an elite group capable of understanding and wielding powerful, non-obvious forces.

#### **Conclusion:**

Michael Aquino's Setian worldview, particularly the concepts related to Lesser Black Magic, the nature of Will, the importance of influencing consciousness and behavior through subtle or non-obvious means, and the idea of an elite body possessing specialized knowledge, appears to have provided a philosophical foundation and practical framework for his thinking on military psychological operations as articulated in "From PSYOP to MindWar." The paper's focus on strategic psychological influence, the use of mass media for widespread effect, the need to understand and manipulate the target's perception and will, and the requirement for expert operators all find resonance in the principles of LBM and Setian initiation described in his other writings. While MindWar frames these goals within a secular military context, the underlying mechanisms and philosophical rationale for prioritizing the manipulation of minds and perception over brute force align significantly with the principles of Black Magic as described within the Temple of Set's philosophy. The noted tension in the MindWar paper between the ideal of "truth" and the pragmatic challenges of real-world application also finds a parallel in the Setian view of ethics as context-dependent and results-oriented, where the _effectiveness_ of influence, rather than inherent morality, is paramount.

### _What is the core belief of Setian initiation?_

Based on the provided sources, the core belief of Setian initiation centers on the development and strengthening of the individual psyche, distinct from the objective universe. This process is referred to by the Egyptian hieroglyphic term **Xeper**.

Here is a detailed elaboration:

1. **The Isolated Psyche as the Core Identity:** Setian philosophy posits that within each individual intelligent life form exists a "non-natural 'presence of self'". This essence, referred to variously as the ba, spirit, psyche, or soul, is understood as something distinct from the physical body and the objective universe. Unlike materialistic views that see consciousness as merely a byproduct of the brain, Setians perceive the psyche as an independent entity. Ancient Egyptians identified this concept as the _ba_, which later became the Greek _psyche_ and the modern "soul". Set is conceptualized as the designer or conceptualizer of this principle of self-awareness. This sensation of being "somehow alien to the physical body" is essential to the notion of the soul.
2. **Xeper: The Process of Self-Becoming:** The Word of the Æon of Set is Xeper. In hieroglyphics, this means "to become/to be/to come into being". Xeper signifies the transformation and evolution of the Will from a human to a divine state of being, achieved through deliberate, conscious, individual force of mind. It is the process by which the psyche becomes aware of itself and then reaches out towards the limitlessness of its conscious existence. This is not a passive process but an active quest. Set is understood as the source of the _potential_ for Xeper in each human animal, but whether an individual recognizes and develops this potential (initiation) is their own prerogative.
3. **Distinction from the Objective Universe (OU):** A fundamental aspect of the Setian worldview is the distinction between the individual's subjective universe (one's personal perspective and self-created phenomena) and the objective universe (the totality of existence occupying time and space). While many religions and philosophies aim for merging the self with the objective universe, Setianism, as a Left-Hand Path (LHP), consciously attempts to preserve and strengthen one's _isolate, psychecentric existence_ against the objective universe. The LHP seeks individual divinity, while the Right-Hand Path (RHP) seeks reabsorption in existing OU divinity. The Temple of Set stands alone in its stance of preserving and exalting the self as something distinct from the objective universe.
4. **Set as the Principle of Distinction:** Set is the neter who is "different" from all others, symbolizing that which is not of nature. He is a presence and force that cannot be apprehended by the natural senses, representing the "nameless 'thing'" whose existence is known by the "shadow it casts" – the non-natural "presence of self" in individual intelligent life. The mythological narrative in _The Diabolicon_ portrays Satan (Set) as the entity who brought Will and intelligence, enabling individuals (angels and humans) to perceive their distinction from God's absolute, static order. Set, as an intelligent entity distinct from the objective universe, instilled in humanity the potential for the same external perspective and the intelligence to use it with deliberate, creative purpose.
5. **The MindStar Concept:** The "soul" or psyche is further elaborated through the concept of the eight-emanation MindStar, which the ancient Egyptians apprehended. These emanations proceed from those more linked to the Objective Universe (OU) to those more linked to the Subjective Universe (SU). While all sentient beings are said to possess the first four emanations (khat, ren, khabit, ab – body, name, shadow, heart/physical consciousness bridge), beings with the "Gift of Set" (awareness of isolate self-consciousness) also possess the _ba_ (core self-awareness) and _ka_ (transmigration/mirror image). Initiatory capacity can awaken the _sekhem_ (neter-emanation/power to draw down divine essence), and in unique instances, the _akh_ (star-emanation/rising to the company of neteru). Setian initiation (Xeper) involves aligning one's consciousness with one's neter (true self) rather than the superficial, animal illusion of "self". It is the ability to explore and actualize the MindStar complex, eternally and universally.
6. **Initiation as Self-Actualization:** True initiation within the Temple of Set is not about acquiring secret knowledge or joining an exclusive club. It is a personal experience of awakening to, comprehending, and actualizing the powers latent within one's intelligence and psychecentric being. The Temple formalizes demonstrated levels of this achievement through "Recognition". The process involves a "Socratic refutation of confused, imprecise, and unsubstantiated information and thinking," imparting truth as much as it is known, and more importantly, the _ability to pursue truth_ and recognize it. It requires intellectual effort, enlightened intuition, and rigorous self-examination.
7. **Contrast with RHP Absorption:** The Setian emphasis on individual distinction stands in direct opposition to RHP goals like Buddhist nirvana, Christian salvation, or absorption into "Cosmic Consciousness" (El) as sought by groups like AMORC. These RHP paths seek the obliteration or dissolution of the separate self, which Setians view as a form of "suicide of oneself in order to sleep forever in dreamless oblivion". The Temple of Set, conversely, aims to affirm, strengthen, glorify, and increase the isolate self-consciousness.

In summary, the core belief of Setian initiation is the deliberate, conscious evolution and strengthening of the individual, non-natural psyche (MindStar) as a distinct and unique entity, a process called Xeper, recognizing Set as the conceptualizer and source of this potential, and rejecting any philosophy that seeks the dissolution or absorption of the self into a collective or universal consciousness.

### _What are the fundamental ethical and metaphysical frameworks informing these distinct approaches to power and influence?_

Based on the sources provided, the approaches to power and influence discussed, primarily the Setian Left-Hand Path (LHP), the Right-Hand Path (RHP)/conventional religions, and secular/political methods, are deeply informed by distinct fundamental ethical and metaphysical frameworks.

Here is an elaboration on these frameworks:

#### **Setian Left-Hand Path (LHP)**

##### **Metaphysical Framework:**

- The Setian worldview posits the existence of a Universe (with a capital 'U') comprising the totality of existence, which includes both the objective universe (OU) and subjective universes (SU). The objective universe consists of phenomena occupying time and space, operating according to consistent patterns or "laws" which science describes as mechanistic. However, the OU is not inherently intelligent or purposeful; it is characterized by natural inertia.
- Within individual intelligent life forms exists a "non-natural 'presence of self'," variously called the psyche, soul, ba, or MindStar. This psyche is distinct from the physical body and the objective universe. Set is understood as the conceptualizer or designer of this principle of self-awareness, an intelligent entity apart from the objective universe who instilled in humanity the potential for this external perspective and deliberate purpose. The sources also mention the ancient Egyptian neteru, understood as primal Principles or Forms of existence, which can be apprehended through a higher mental function called _nœsis_. Set is distinct from the natural neteru. The MindStar concept, drawn from ancient Egyptian understanding, details the psyche as having eight emanations, ranging from those linked to the OU (khat, ren, khabit, ab) to those linked to the SU (ba, ka, sekhem, akh), representing increasing levels of self-awareness and connection to divine essence or star-emanation.
- A fundamental belief is the inherent immortality of the ba/psyche, not as a product of material existence or subject to posthumous judgment, but as an eternal aspect of consciousness. "This life" provides a vehicle for the psyche to become aware of itself and reach towards its conscious limitlessness.
- An Æon is conceptualized not merely as a period of time, but as a "Ding an sich," a noumenon, or in a Greater Black Magic (GBM) sense, a living entity comprised of its initiates.
- Magic, defined as the art and science of causing change in accordance with will, is approached through the non-natural interaction with the objective and subjective universes. Lesser Black Magic (LBM) influences the OU through obscure physical/behavioral laws, while Greater Black Magic (GBM) causes change in the subjective universe in accordance with will, which may then influence the objective universe via the Magical Link – a conceptual link between the two universes. Medial Black Magic (MBM) is a simplified GBM focused on OU influence. Black Magic is a deliberate effort to place one's self apart and distinct from the objective universe and its governing principles.

##### **Ethical Framework:**

- Setian ethics are based on individual responsibility and self-determined principles, rejecting morality imposed by external authorities (divine law, social convention, political systems). Ethics is viewed as a normative science seeking principles of good and evil that transcend convention.
- Truth is considered an absolute Form or first principle, apprehended through intellectual effort and enlightened intuition (_nœsis_), not faith or popularity. Wisdom, gained through rigorous self-examination and intellectual effort, involves understanding truth and recognizing it, including the ethical components of actions.
- The LHP orientation itself implies no inherent moral stance; it refers to techniques of preserving the isolate self. LBM practice requires rigorous ethics because of the potential for misuse and harmful consequences, not due to intrinsic "evil" in the techniques. Petty egoism or vulgar purposes are seen as less satisfying uses of power, which should ideally be used for the greater satisfaction derived from exercising wisdom.
- The Setian stance on ethics contrasts with egoism which sees actions solely in the interest of the stronger, but acknowledges figures like Nietzsche as relevant thinkers. The core is the strengthening of the individual will and psyche, which inherently leads to ethical consideration when interacting with others and the world.

##### **Approach to Power and Influence:**

- Power and influence are seen as inherent capacities within the individual's intelligence and psyche. Initiation is the process of awakening to, comprehending, and actualizing these latent powers through deliberate, conscious effort (Xeper). The Temple serves as a vehicle to aid this self-initiation.
- Power is exercised through various forms of magic (LBM, MBM, GBM). The goal is not to merge with or be controlled by external forces, but to affirm, strengthen, glorify, and increase one's isolate self-consciousness as a distinct entity.
- Setian initiation leads to increased understanding and the capacity to influence reality, particularly through GBM's effect on the subjective universe which in turn affects the objective. Higher initiatory degrees (Priest/Priestess, Magister, Magus, Ipsissimus) represent increasing levels of understanding, power, and integration with the Æon and the Universe. The Priesthood, consecrated to Set, are seen as living Temples through whose souls the current of the Æon flows, representing a merging/augmentation of consciousness with Set without loss of personal identity.

#### **Right-Hand Path (RHP) / Conventional Religions**

##### **Metaphysical Framework:**

- RHP philosophies and conventional religions often assume a singular creator God (El, YHVH, Universal Intelligence) who is the ultimate reality. The objective universe is frequently seen as a creation or manifestation of this divine entity.
- A core concept is the desire or goal to dissolve, merge, or become one with this universal consciousness or the objective universe. This often involves transcending or obliterating the individual ego or "separate self".
- Belief in an afterlife (Heaven, Hell, Amenti) and/or cyclical existence (reincarnation, karma) is common, providing a context for post-mortem consequences or further soul evolution. Hebrew theology initially focused on _nephesh_ (animal life force) and corporeal revivification, while later forms and derivatives (Christianity, Kabbalah, AMORC) adopted or incorporated ideas of an independently surviving _psyche_ (soul), sometimes within a framework of reincarnation.
- The Universe may be understood through concepts like the Cabalistic Tree of Life, mapping emanations from the divine source.
- White Magic (WM), as defined by the Temple of Set, is a characteristic practice, involving efforts to deceive oneself or others into believing communication or acceptance by El; it is seen as intrinsically impotent for actual metaphysical change but effective as propaganda or a psychological control device. RHP groups like AMORC define WM/BM based on the practitioner's moral intent (good/evil).

##### **Ethical Framework:**

- Ethics are largely based on obedience to the will of God, adherence to revealed laws (like the Ten Commandments), or the dictates of religious institutions and clergy. Virtue is often defined by compliance, faith, and adherence to prescribed behaviors, sometimes prioritizing obedience over rational understanding or immediate social consequences.
- The individual self/ego is often viewed negatively, as the source of "original sin" or separation from the divine, and requires purification or destruction.
- Fear of posthumous punishment (Hell, unfavorable reincarnation) is a significant motivator for adherence and ethical compliance.
- Truth is often based on irrational faith or dogma, particularly regarding the nature and existence of God, which are presented as beyond human comprehension.

##### **Approach to Power and Influence:**

- Power is sought through aligning oneself with or appealing to the divine authority or universal forces. The goal of RHP initiation is often increased understanding and spiritual coherence for the purpose of merging with the universal consciousness, though this process paradoxically strengthens the individual self prior to the intended dissolution.
- Influence over adherents is primarily achieved through childhood indoctrination, appealing to fear and desire for salvation/reward in adults, and leveraging social pressures.
- Rituals may be employed, understood by Setians as psychodrama or means of inducing autohypnosis/mass hypnosis to reinforce belief and control behavior. White Magic (WM) in this context involves appealing to conceived divine entities for assistance. The ultimate aim of RHP initiation is the dissolution of the separate self, which is seen as the path to immortality or integration with the divine.

#### **Secular/Political Power and Influence**

##### **Metaphysical/Conceptual Framework:**

- These approaches often operate from an atheistic, agnostic, materialistic, or deistic standpoint, rejecting or downplaying the existence of metaphysical realities beyond the observable. Consciousness may be seen as solely a function or byproduct of the physical brain. The subjective universe is often dismissed as mere fantasy or escapism with no real impact on the objective world.
- The objective universe is understood to operate according to discoverable, predictable, mechanistic natural laws, amenable to scientific study.
- Complex social or historical phenomena may be attributed to impersonal forces (economic struggle, dialectic materialism - Marx), the "spirit of the state" (Volksgeist - Hegel), or inherent human nature (Hobbes) rather than divine intervention. Deism, as a secularized view, posits a creator God who does not intervene in the universe, allowing human affairs to proceed according to natural laws and human will.

##### **Ethical Framework:**

- Ethics are frequently grounded in human-made constructs such as social contracts (agreements between individuals or citizens and the state), utilitarian principles (greatest good for the greatest number), or prevailing cultural customs and standards (descriptive ethics, ethical relativism).
- Truth and ethics may be seen as democratic concepts determined by collective agreement or vote. Moral terms may be considered arbitrary, subjective expressions of emotion or disguised commands (skepticism, emotivism, subjectivism, imperativism).
- Outcome-justified thinking, where the morality of an action is determined by its consequences (Machiavelli) or its service to a perceived historical destiny (Marxism), is prevalent.
- Individual responsibility may be submerged or suppressed in favor of the collective good or the state's authority. Hobbesian egoism, where "justice" is simply the interest of the stronger, informs some views.

##### **Approach to Power and Influence:**

- Power is exercised through controlling the objective universe and the behavior of individuals within it. This involves understanding and manipulating observable phenomena and human psychology.
- Techniques include LBM (applied psychology, manipulation of obscure physical/behavioral laws), politics (power-seeking, sometimes disguised), and propaganda (behavior-control, mass LBM application). The aim is often to control individuals without their conscious awareness.
- The Lockean framework, influential in the US, sees power residing in the will of the citizenry and limits government power, behaving atheistically in its decision-making processes. In contrast, systems influenced by Hegel or Marx may see the state or historical forces as a "higher authority," leading to authoritarian control and justifying actions in service to these forces, effectively behaving theistically.

#### Summary

In summary, these distinct approaches to power and influence are fundamentally shaped by contrasting views on the nature of reality (metaphysics) and the basis for right action (ethics). Setianism focuses on the non-natural, isolate individual psyche and its self-willed evolution (Xeper), exercising power through understanding and influencing both subjective and objective realities based on self-determined ethics and apprehended truth. Conventional religions and RHP paths often seek power and influence through aligning with or submitting to an external divine authority or universal consciousness, aiming for the dissolution of the individual self based on revealed laws and faith, often using fear and reward as motivators. Secular and political systems typically operate within a materialist, agnostic, or deistic framework, seeking power through the manipulation of the objective universe and human behavior based on social contracts, utilitarianism, or perceived group/state interests, often employing LBM techniques like politics and propaganda.
