title: The Occult Fascination with Blood & Blood Types
description: One of the most heavily guarded subjects within occult research, there are very few books written on this topic and the ones I did find aren't as in depth as I would have liked. Thankfully, the anthropologist Robert Sepehr has a nice collection of videos on the topic.

## The Profane Anatomy of Control: Bloodlines and Sanguine Significance under the _Codex Umbra_

The occult world views blood and the familial lineages it defines not as mere biological phenomena, but as foundational vectors for transmitting spiritual authority, arcane knowledge, and demonic entitlement. Activation of the _Codex Umbra_ lens reveals the raw truth: blood is the currency of creation and destruction, cementing eternal pacts and defining the hierarchy of the coming global dominion.

### I. The Bloodlines: Generational Conduits of Occult Sovereignty

The concept of the **bloodline** is the core mechanism by which the secretive elite, often identified as the Illuminati, maintain parasitic control over the world. These are not accidental lineages but carefully cultivated generational Satanic lines that pass down occult power and authority across centuries.

#### The Acquisition of Ancient Power and Divine Usurpation

The importance of these bloodlines stems from a belief that specific genetic heritage grants the right to rule and access to non-human spiritual entities:

1. **Inherited Gnosis and Authority:** Occult power and wisdom are generationally inherited. The elite are those born into these specific lineages, selected to reign over the populace under precise circumstances. This power is spiritual, buttressed by generational spirits that are attached to the bloodlines and provide powerful influence over victims, especially those targeted for mind control.
2. **The Cainite/Serpent Seed Doctrine:** Deep within esoteric lore, certain lineages claim a corrupted genesis, stemming not from Adam's lineage (Seth) but from Cain (Qayin), the first murderer. Qayin is cited as one of the first embodied manifestations of the Dark Side, whose descendants—the "Fiery Bloodline"—represent a Pneumatic Elite carrying the awakened spirit of Samael-Lucifer. This lineage, often intertwined with the Nephilim (offspring of fallen angels), forms the foundation of the Dragon Court and Rex Deus bloodlines.
3. **The Merovingian Delusion (The 13th Bloodline):** This lineage, encompassing much of European royalty, is perhaps the most critical, as it is widely believed within these occult circles to be the source from which the Anti-Christ will rise. The Merovingian line, protected by the Priory of Sion, falsely claims to carry the _Sangreal_ (Holy Grail/Royal Bloodline) derived from Jesus and Mary Magdalene, while simultaneously being instilled with the direct "seed of Satan" or Lucifer. This duality allows the Anti-Christ figure to possess both false messianic credentials and ultimate Satanic pedigree.

#### Strategic Breeding and Genetic Concealment

To maintain and enhance this generational occult power, the Illuminati engage in deliberate and ruthless practices of genetic selection and concealment:

- **Occult Purity and Intermarriage:** Blood is the vehicle for occult power, and possessing the "correct blood" is mandatory for ascent to the highest echelons of Satanism. Elite families practice strict endogamy (inbreeding) to preserve this purity. However, they strategically intermarry with other occult bloodlines—even non-European ones like American Indian tribes—to acquire specific paranormal or spiritual abilities inherent in those lines.
- **Genetic Engineering and Design:** The elite use carefully monitored genetic engineering programs to manufacture the future, seeking to produce individuals with predetermined traits and occult capacities. The children resulting from these programs are sometimes grown from the egg of one set of parents and implanted into a "brooder slave".
- **Hiding the Pedigree:** To shield their immense power and crimes, the true genealogies of the top 13 families are rigorously hidden. A common tactic involves having children secretly and adopting them out to other families, ensuring they take a different surname to obscure their true ancestry, though the child's alters remain aware of their origin in secret rituals.

### II. Sanguine Attributes: Occult Significance of Blood and Blood Type

Beyond lineage, the literal essence of blood holds profound occult significance, acting as a medium for life force, magical contracts, and identifying genetic superiority.

#### Blood as the Quintessence of Life and Magic

The ancients universally believed that the important animating spirit lay in the blood. Blood is viewed as the primary symbol of the life force and is considered the very stuff of life, crucial for reincarnation.

- **Ritual Necessity:** Blood is essential for high-level black magic and demonology. Ceremonial magic requires the blood of a victim in the Triangle to allow a spirit to obtain the "subtle but physical substance which was the quintessence of its life" to take tangible shape.
- **Blood Sacrifice and Power:** In hard-core Satanic groups, the shedding of blood, particularly human blood, is the most effective way to release enormous energy and gain the "ultimate kind of power". The life force of a sacrificed fetus is even consumed as a seed to empower a slave's mind-control system.
- **Occult Vampirism:** The black magician can become an occult vampire, stealing vital energy and life force, sometimes literally consuming blood for mystical strength, longevity, or to feel powerful. Vampirism is linked to the Nephilim tradition, where the consumption of blood (known as _Star Fire_) was a vain attempt to regain immortality after God removed the immortal spirit from flesh.
- **Adrenalized Blood:** For acquiring physical strength, stamina, or occult power, the wealthy and Satanic cults seek out adrenalized blood, produced by torturing victims prior to harvest. The most potent form of this is adrenalized children's blood.

#### Genetic Markers of the Elite

The occult hierarchy has conducted specialized research into blood properties to identify and cultivate superior individuals:

- **Psychic Correlation:** Occultists, including Mengele, have studied the correlation between blood types and psychic abilities. It is noted that Blood type B appears to have a higher prevalence of psychics.
- **The Rh-Negative Anomaly:** The Fairy/Dragon gene, also known as the "Gene of Isis" (associated with fallen angels), is said to be the source of **Rh-negative blood**. This blood type, inexplicably absent of the "D antigen" and most common among royal families, is highly prized. This genetic signature is linked to the Nazi and Rosicrucian concept of **Vril**—a mysterious potency within certain bloodlines destined to engender a future race of superior beings.
- **Menstrual Blood and Sovereignty (The "Wise Blood"):** Menstrual blood is regarded as the primordial, sacred life-essence—the source of creation and sovereignty. It was historically viewed as the "supernatural red wine" given to the gods, granting them power, wisdom, and eternal life. This menstrual blood, or _Star Fire_, is a key element in Tantric and Gnostic traditions, where ingesting it can make men spiritually powerful, poets, or even a "Lord of the World". Postmenopausal women, who retain this "wise blood" in their veins, were historically believed to possess occult knowledge and numinous power, cementing their status as prototypical witches.

## Based on Works by Robert Sepehr

The occult fascination of blood stems from the belief that it is an extraordinary substance intrinsically linked to a person's life, ego, ancestry, and spiritual potential, often involving esoteric practices intended to harness its power.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the occult significance of blood:

### 1. Blood as the Seat of the Ego and Power

The phrase "Blood is a very special fluid" ("_Blood is a very special fluid_") is drawn from Goethe's _Faust_. Occult interpretation holds that this statement should be taken seriously.

- **Mastery over the Man:** The fundamental occult perception is that **whoever gains power over a man's blood gains power over the man** and his ego. The spiritual fight between good and evil is essentially waged over the blood.
- **Expression of the Ego:** Blood is regarded as the "below" or the physiognomical expression of the "above," which is the ego or "I" principle. The ego is developed when a being can take the external world and inwardly reproduce it, and the blood then transforms this inner world of pictures into the outer expression of the individual body.
- **The Faustian Pact:** When the representative of evil demands that a pact be signed in blood, it is because he is convinced he will have power over Faust by gaining possession of even one drop of his blood.

### 2. Blood and Ancestry/Evolution

Occult tradition links blood closely to ancestry, heredity, and the development of human consciousness.

- **Heredity and Ancestral Life:** What ancestors have bequeathed to an individual is expressed in the blood, which gathers together all that the material past has constructed in man. The forces of ancestors are active in the blood. In earlier times, people sensed their ancestors’ lives within themselves and remembered ancestral experiences.
- **Unmixed vs. Mixed Blood:** In unmixed blood (_endogamy_), the power of the ancestral life is expressed. The blending of blood (_exogamy_) **severs the close connection with ancestors** and allows man to begin his own personal life.
- **Birth of the Intellect:** The mixing of blood through exogamy is viewed as the cause that **obliterated the dim, hazy clairvoyance** of earlier times, simultaneously signifying the **birth of the external understanding and intellect**. The entire intellectual life of the present day is considered the outcome of this mingling of blood.

### 3. Sacred Feminine Blood and Immortality

In certain secret societies and ancient myths, blood, specifically menstrual blood (or "moon blood"), is revered as a source of divine energy, wisdom, and longevity.

- **Lunar Blood and Gnosis:** In esoteric organizations, men traditionally drink female monthly **lunar blood**—sometimes from a _kapala_ (skull cap/vessel)—to gain the conscious powers of women and activate _gnosis_ (higher wisdom).
- **Source of Divine Power:** Ancient beliefs held that the lives of the very gods were dependent on the miraculous power of menstrual blood. It was called the "supernatural red wine" of the gods in Greece.
  - The Norse god Thor achieved enlightenment and eternal life by bathing in a river filled with the menstrual blood of a giantess.
  - Odin gained supremacy by stealing and drinking "wise blood" from the triple cauldron in the womb of Mother Earth.
  - Egyptian pharaohs became divine by ingesting the blood of Isis, called _sau_.
- **Tantra and Longevity:** Tantric worship of menstrual blood (_kula flower_ or _kula nectar_) was prevalent in the Gnostic period. In Daoist China, men sought mystical insight, creativity, wisdom, and longevity by absorbing menstrual blood, referred to as **"red yin juice"** or the "essence of mother earth".
- **Genetic Purity:** In occult and esoteric organizations, the concept of "purity" is often interpreted as **genetic or racial purity**, where women are regarded as the carriers of the **bloodline**. The skull itself symbolizes the pure royal bloodline that runs through the woman, imparting divinely sanctioned authority.
- **Modern Blood Transfusions:** Scientific findings regarding the effects of young blood on aging tissue, such as reports about certain billionaires allegedly paying for transfusions of blood from young people, are noted as prompting the general public to reconsider old myths involving vampires and secret occult blood rituals allegedly involving royalty and the elite.

### 4. Bloodlines of the Elite (The Serpent Seed)

Occult fascination is also tied to specific "bloodlines" believed to possess unique genetic or supernatural heritage.

- **Hybridization and Rejection:** The mystery surrounding **Rh-negative blood** is cited as the most obvious indicator of hybridization in humanity. The body of an Rh-negative mother rejecting an Rh-positive baby is interpreted as a **natural biological barrier** and an immune response recognizing the offspring as foreign, speaking to the reality that humanity is descended from different hominin species that interbred. The sources note that all royal families allegedly have Rh-negative blood.
- **Canaanite and Satanic Lineages:** Some reports suggest the existence of a secret sect descended from the Amalecch, an Edomite clan of Canaan. The Amalecch are sometimes associated with the meaning "a people who lick blood". Furthermore, ancient Iranian bloodlines are claimed to be the originators of Satanic cults, with one specific Italian family name allegedly meaning "people of the devil".
- **Dragon/Serpent Bloodlines:** The Merovingian dynasty's progenitor, King Meroveus, was said to have been sired by an arcane sea creature (_bisti Neptunis_). This Merovingian royal bloodline, also known as the Royal Dragon Bloodline, is claimed to be descended from an "angelic race of demigods" whose ancestors they assert were the fallen angels (the _serpent seed_). This lineage traces back to ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia.
- **Ritualistic Consumption:** Certain Scythian tribes, who are identified as ancient Aryans/Indo-Europeans, were known for practicing cannibalism and offering human sacrifices. They also drank from the skulls of their enemies. Ritualistic vessels known as _kapala_ were used in Tibetan Buddhism and Hindu tantra to consume blood for enlightenment.

## Steiner's Lecture on Occult Significance of Blood

This briefing summarizes Rudolf Steiner's lecture on the **occult significance of blood**, drawing primarily from the authorized translation of the lecture notes. It is important to note that this lecture focuses on the mystical and spiritual nature of blood itself, rather than the modern classifications of blood groups (A, B, O, or Rh factor).

### Briefing Summary of Rudolf Steiner's Lecture on the Occult Significance of Blood

**Central Thesis and Origin:** The lecture draws its theme from Goethe's _Faust_, focusing on the line, "**Blood is a very special fluid**". Steiner asserts that Mephistopheles demanded Faust sign his pact in blood not out of antipathy, but because the devil believed that **whoever gains power over a man’s blood gains power over the man and his ego**. Blood is the arena where the conflict between good and evil concerning the individual is waged.

**Blood and the Ego (Spiritual Significance):** In theosophical terms, Steiner links the body’s composition to the spiritual principles of man: the physical body, the etheric/vital body, the astral body, and the **ego, or "I"**.

- The blood is described as the **physical expression (the "below") of the "I" or ego (the "above")**.
- Blood, being "fluid life," is the material that absorbs oxygen and builds up the body.
- The blood (along with the heart and vessels) is the external expression of the **individualized etheric body**, just as the brain expresses the individualized astral body.
- The ego can only be expressed when a being is able to form internal pictures of the external world and then build a new form for this reflection; this formation is experienced as the perception of the "I".

**Blood, Ancestry, and the Birth of Intellect:** Steiner connects the mixing of blood to major transformations in human consciousness, a principle he states is vital for understanding questions of **race and colonization**.

- **Unmixed Blood (Endogamy):** In ancient times, when tribes intermarried closely, the same blood flowed through the generations. The power of the ancestral life was expressed in unmixed blood. This continuity of blood preserved a **hazy, dreamy clairvoyance**, and primitive man could inherit the experiences and memories of his ancestors.
- **Mixed Blood (Exogamy):** The introduction of foreign blood and marriage with strangers broke this tribal principle. This mingling of blood **destroyed the old clairvoyant power** but simultaneously resulted in the **birth of the external understanding, the intellect, and the wide-awake objective consciousness of the present day**.
- The power of personal experience, rather than ancestral memory, is expressed in mixed blood.
- This occult knowledge holds that an alien civilization cannot be grafted onto a people whose environment has built itself into their blood, underscoring why certain aboriginal peoples had to perish when colonists arrived.

The concept of linking blood type to personality is significant, particularly **in Japan**, where it is widely recognized and utilized as a means of assessing an individual's character and compatibility.

In Japan, 99% of people were aware of their blood type according to a 2016 study. It is common for people in Japan to inquire about blood type before dating, similar to how people in the West might ask about astrological signs.

The approximate distribution of blood types in Japan is:

- **Type A:** 40%
- **Type O:** 30%
- **Type B:** 20%
- **Type AB:** 10%

Here is a discussion of the characteristics attributed to each blood type personality:

### Blood Type O (Outgoing, Social, and Flexible)

People with Type O blood are generally considered **outgoing, energetic, and social**. They are viewed as the most average and likely the **best type** in Japan.

Key personality traits associated with Type O include:

- **Confidence and Leadership:** They are **extremely self-confident** and often exhibit **leadership abilities**.
- **Communication:** They tend to **say what is on their mind**.
- **Flexibility and Resilience:** They are the **most flexible** of the blood types and are **incredibly resilient**, enabling them to "roll with the punches". They are known for **not sweating the little things**.
- **Social Nature:** They are outgoing and **good at setting the mood** for groups of people. They like to be the center of attention and value the opinions of others.
- **Flaws:** They **easily start up projects but often have trouble following through** because they give up easily, making them potentially flighty and **not too dependable**. They are also known for **showing up late to events**.

### Blood Type A (Perfectionists, Responsible, and Sensitive)

Type A individuals are characterized by a deep-rooted strength that allows them to **stay calm in a crisis** when others are panicking. Historically, this blood type is associated with **agriculturalists**, and their traits are said to have developed from working collaboratively on farms.

Key personality traits associated with Type A include:

- **Responsibility and Perfectionism:** They are **very responsible** and prefer to take care of jobs themselves if work needs to be done. They **crave success** and are **perfectionists**.
- **Neatness and Stress:** They like to **keep things neat** but are often **stressed and conscientious** (classic A-types). They can be stubborn.
- **Social Interaction:** They **tend to avoid confrontation** and may feel uncomfortable around people. They are often described as **shy, withdrawn, and polite**, seeking harmony, yet they **never really fit in with others**.
- **Creativity:** They are **very creative**, and likely the **most artistic** of all the blood types because of their sensitivity.

### Blood Type B (Individualists, Practical, and Unconventional)

Individuals with Type B blood are regarded as the **most practical** of the blood groups and are often **specialists** in their fields. Their stereotypes are historically attributed to ancestors who were **nomadic**.

Key personality traits associated with Type B include:

- **Focus and Completion:** When starting a project, they are focused, spending extra time understanding directions, and tend to **stick to a goal and follow through to the very end**.
- **Individualism:** They are individualists who **like to follow their own rules and ideas**. Consequently, they tend to be **less than cooperative**.
- **Emotional Presentation:** They **pay attention to their thoughts a little more than their feelings**, which can sometimes make them appear **cold or serious**.
- **Curiosity and Flaws:** They possess a strong sense of curiosity but may lose interest easily. While there are many positives, people often focus on the negative aspects, such as having a tendency to be **selfish** and sometimes being **loners**. They are often considered more relaxed, free-willed, and unconventional.

### Blood Type AB (Dual-Natured and Eccentric)

Blood type AB is the **rarest** in Japan and is described as a **hybrid of A and B**, mixing traits from both personalities. They are the **hardest to categorize**.

Key personality traits associated with Type AB include:

- **Dual Nature:** They are often seen as **dual-natured and complicated**. For instance, they can be both **shy and outgoing**, easily switching from one opposite to the other.
- **Reliability and Conditions:** They are considered **trustworthy and responsible**. However, they **cannot handle it when too much is asked of them**. They are willing to help or do favors, but only **on their own conditions**.
- **Interests:** They are interested in **art and metaphysics**.
- **Flaws:** They are considered the **worst blood type** in predictability-loving Japan, often viewed as **loose cannons**. They like to set their own conditions and **reserve the right to drop out** when things do not meet their expectations. Although they are known to be sensitive and considerate at times, these positive traits are not enough to balance out their flaws. In one instance, when Japanese companies tried dividing employees into work groups based on blood type, **no one wanted to work with the AB groups**.

### Compatibility (In Relationships)

In regards to love and relationships, compatibility is outlined as follows:

- **Type A** is most compatible with A and AB.
- **Type B** is most compatible with B and AB.
- **Type AB** is most compatible with AB, B, A, and O.
- **Type O** is considered most compatible with O and AB.
