<Card title="Masonic Handshakes, Identifiers, Passwords & Symbols" img="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!eTcc!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-video.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fvideo_upload%2Fpost%2F146887791%2F49d42400-a3d0-43b1-b1f0-1ee1c8b4cbea%2Ftranscoded-1721668217.png" description="Accurate information revealed by Bill Schnoebelen, information has been confirmed by a Freemason whom I know personally." href="https://theofficialurban.substack.com/p/masonic-handshakes-identifiers-passwords?r=3kr5wz" />

This source presents a scathing critique of Freemasonry from a Christian perspective, primarily arguing that the fraternity is a **deceptive, anti-Christian cult** rooted in **occultism and paganism**. The author recounts his personal spiritual journey, detailing how a visit to a Masonic temple and subsequent intense Bible study led him to realize that the organization’s practices, oaths, and "generic" God were incompatible with his rediscovered faith in Jesus Christ. Key themes include the exposure of Masonic authority figures like Albert Pike, who allegedly equated the biblical God ("Adonay") with a false, evil deity subservient to **Lucifer**, and the belief that the secrecy and tiered structure of Masonry are designed to **mislead the uninitiated** about its true esoteric, and ultimately satanic, underpinnings. The text also warns that Masonic involvement, even in auxiliary groups like the **Order of the Eastern Star**, opens participants and their families to **demonic influence** and advocates for complete renunciation of the Lodge and its **abominable oaths** for anyone seeking to be a true follower of Christ.

#### _Blood on the Doorposts (2011)_

The provided text, excerpted from a book on spiritual warfare, details the authors' ministry and theology concerning demonic affliction, particularly focusing on those with backgrounds in the occult, Satanism, and ritual abuse (SRA). A central theme is the belief that psychiatric concepts like **Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD)** are often a "look-alike" for a purely demonic problem, especially infestation by the **Spirit of Legion**, and that human-centered therapy is inadequate. The authors strongly advocate for a **Biblically-based deliverance ministry** that prioritizes repenting of sin, breaking ungodly soul ties (particularly sexual ones), renouncing generational curses, and using the authority of **Jesus Christ** to cast out demons, rather than psychologically probing for traumatic memories already **"crucified with Christ."** Furthermore, the text warns that seemingly innocent practices, such as **hypnosis**, involvement in 12-Step programs, and having occult objects or modern Bible translations in the home, can act as **"doorways"** for demonic access and attack.

#### _Wicca (2011)_

This text, an excerpt from William Schnoebelen's book *Wicca*, primarily serves as a deeply personal **testimony and polemic** against modern witchcraft, asserting that the spiritual path of Wicca inevitably leads to Satanism. The foreword, written by Ed Decker, establishes Schnoebelen's credibility by detailing the **close spiritual scrutiny** he underwent following his conversion to Christianity after years as a high-ranking witch. Schnoebelen's introduction and subsequent chapters recount his fervent **devotion to the Goddess** in Wicca, only to later conclude that the distinction between "white witchcraft" and Satanism is **non-existent**, realizing his only hope was in **Jesus Christ**. He extensively critiques Wiccan doctrines, such as the manufactured history of the "Old Religion," the **fatalistic and logically flawed concept of reincarnation** (karma), and the pervasive **influence of Aleister Crowley** and sexual magic in high-degree rituals, arguing that all pagan religions are ultimately **controlled by Satan**.

#### _Lucifer Dethroned_

This text, excerpted from William Schnoebelen's *Lucifer Dethroned*, serves as a detailed personal testimony and exposé on the world of **Satanism and the occult**, blending autobiography with doctrinal instruction. The narrative sections recount the author's descent into a dark existence, including **vampirism and ritual sacrifice**, and disturbing visions of "Great Old Ones," before his eventual conversion to Christianity. Furthermore, the text analyzes different levels of Satanic belief, from the **atheistic Church of Satan** founded by Anton LaVey, to more deeply occult systems like Thelema and **Transyuggothian Magick** involving entities like Cthulhu, revealing the elaborate deceptions used to enslave followers. Ultimately, the book aims to equip Christians by exposing the **infrastructure of Satanism** and providing methods for effective evangelism and deliverance for those involved in the occult.

#### _Romancing Death: The True Story of Vampirism, Death, the Occult & Deliverance_

This extensive source, drawn from a book exploring the dangers of the occult, details the author's **bizarre pilgrimage** from a devout Catholic youth to a practicing vampire, witch, and Satanist, ultimately leading to his conversion to orthodox Christianity. Key themes include the seductive nature of **occultism and vampirism** in modern culture, particularly as glamorized in media like the *Twilight* saga, which the author argues fills a spiritual **vacuum** left by the Church. The author also stresses the crucial importance of the **Holy Bible** as the only objective truth, contrasting it with the ever-changing doctrines of man-made institutions and the subjective beliefs of the occult. Furthermore, the text addresses the **spiritual reality** of phenomena like werewolves and the **addictive and harmful** nature of modern entertainment, urging believers to exercise discernment and pursue **righteousness** over the ways of death.

## **My Journey Through Darkness: From Occult Master to Follower of Christ**

### Introduction: A Life in Chains

At the height of my spiritual bondage, I was a vampire-in-training. My days were lived in near darkness, my nights spent in a specially constructed coffin, surrounded by consecrated earth brought from my home town’s Catholic cemetery. I wasn't just playing a role; I was consumed by a physical and spiritual craving for human blood. While other men might crave the bodies of women, I desired only their necks or their femoral arteries, the life-giving blood pulsing just beneath the skin. My heroes were figures like Nero, Hitler, and Dracula, and I believed I was in daily contact with them through unholy spirit guides who were slowly transforming me into an immortal.

How could any human being fall to such a place of depravity? It was not a sudden plunge but a long, gradual seduction by evil, a sixteen-year journey down a path paved with promises of power and wisdom. This is the story of how I became a master in the kingdom of darkness and, more importantly, how I found my miraculous escape through the overwhelming power and unconditional love of Jesus Christ.

### 1. The First Whispers: An Early Fascination with the Unknown

#### 1.1. Childhood Glimpses Beyond the Veil

My journey began not with a conscious choice, but with unsettling invitations from a spiritual world I could not comprehend. As a young boy on Halloween night, I looked up and saw the familiar starry sky twisting and writhing as if alive. Dozens of obscene, tumor-like clusters of festering creatures, each with glowing ruby-red eyes, blotted out the firmament. An almost sexual surge of alien power washed over me, and a voice resonated in my mind: "You belong to us now."

Years later, while standing by a lake in Wisconsin, I witnessed another terrifying spectacle. An immense, star-blotting entity, a black silhouette of a being so vast it seemed to stride across the entire dome of the heavens in a single step, moved with impossible speed. These two events were not random; they were the first whispers from the darkness, beckoning me toward a path of supernatural power and terror.

#### 1.2. Stepping onto the Path: From Seances to Sorcery

My first active step into the occult came in college. Fascinated by a local ghost story, a group of friends and I conducted a séance to contact a spirit in a campus music hall. The silence of our circle was shattered as the huge oak doors to the tomb within the music hall, where the ghost was supposedly interred, began to bang with furious, deafening power. The terrifying results fueled my interest.

Determined to prove my mettle, I purchased a sorcery workbook, _The Greater Key of Solomon_, and returned to the tomb alone on the anniversary of the woman's death. I performed a lengthy ritual of exorcism, my heart racing, expecting at any moment to be torn to pieces. When I finished, there was only silence. The ghost was gone. This success in seemingly commanding the spirit world was the final push I needed. It solidified my faith in the power of magic and officially launched my career as a sorcerer.

### 2. The Great Deception: My Life as a Wiccan High Priest

#### 2.1. The Allure of the Goddess

Initially, Wicca (or "white witchcraft") was intoxicating. I saw it as a beautiful, ancient nature religion, a return to a pure and innocent faith centered on a "Great Mother" goddess. My devotion was zealous and all-consuming. I drove hundreds of miles each weekend to teach Wicca to eager students. At my initiation, I stood blindfolded, naked, and bound at the edge of a magic circle, felt the prick of a sword against my chest, and was anointed as a "Priest of the Goddess." I had given my life to her service, believing she was the key to all spiritual fulfillment.

#### 2.2. Cracks in the Facade

As my wife, Sharon, and I rose to the rank of High Priest and Priestess, we began to see troubling inconsistencies that betrayed Wicca's benevolent image.

- **Satanic Symbols:** I was shocked to discover that the sacred symbol traced on my body during my initiation into the Second Grade High Priesthood was the inverted pentagram—a symbol universally associated with Satanism.
- **The Crowley Connection:** We learned that Wicca's founder, Gerald Gardner, was a friend and colleague of the infamous Satanist Aleister Crowley. Historical evidence strongly suggests that Gardner hired Crowley to write significant portions of Wicca's most sacred rituals, including those found in the _Book of Shadows_.
- **Moral Ambiguity:** The central ethical guide for Wiccans, the Wiccan Rede, states, "An it harm none, do what ye will." This sounds noble, but in practice, the lines blur completely. We began by justifying "harmless" love spells, then moved to prosperity spells, and finally found ourselves wrestling with requests to perform destructive curses, even death spells, all under the guise of serving the "greater good."

#### 2.3. The Unveiling

The final and most crucial deception of Wicca was a psychological teaching that served as a direct bridge to Satanism. We were taught that to become whole, an adept must embrace their "Shadow"—their personal darkness, their inner beast, their devil. Influential Wiccan leaders advised that this was the key to true self-understanding.

"When we recognize this devil as an aspect of ourselves, then the SHADOW functions as a teacher and initiator… providing us with the greatest gift of all, self-understanding."

This teaching was the final unveiling. It revealed that the benevolent "Horned God" of Wicca and the "Dark Lord" of the underworld were not separate entities from Satan; they were simply more palatable masks for the same evil being. The path to wisdom, I was now convinced, required a full embrace of what I once thought was evil.

### 3. The Descent into Hell: My Career in Satanism

#### 3.1. The First Degree: A Church Without a Devil

With the encouragement of my "spirit guides," I eagerly joined the Church of Satan. To my initial disappointment, it felt more like joining the Rotary Club than a legion of the damned. I paid a $20 fee and received a membership card. This was "mail-order evil." The church's founder, Anton LaVey, taught that Satan was not a real being but a symbol for indulgence, vengeance, and rebellion against the hypocrisy of Christianity. For LaVey, Satanism was a religion of the flesh, not of the spirit. While it fell short of the supernatural power I craved, it served as an intellectual stepping stone, normalizing the explicit embrace of evil.

#### 3.2. Seeking the Currents of Power

My spirit guides instructed me that to gain true power, I needed to tap into two immense, seemingly contradictory, currents of magical energy flowing through human history.

| Path Pursued            | Occult Purpose                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Freemasonry**         | To tap into the "Johannine" (from St. John) current of magickal energy. |
| **Catholic Priesthood** | To tap into the "Petrine" (from St. Peter) current of magickal energy.  |

I was taught that while these forces appeared to be in opposition, at their highest, most secret levels, they converge into a single, immense source of occult power. I was being taught to corrupt the very streams God had established, twisting the legacies of Peter and John into conduits for demonic power, a perversion I pursued with blind ambition. My entry into both worlds was shockingly swift. Through a series of what I then saw as miraculous coincidences, I was sponsored into a Masonic lodge. Simultaneously, I began studying for the priesthood in a branch of the Old Roman Catholic Church, a process that culminated two years later in my ordination as a priest and, eventually, my consecration as a bishop.

#### 3.3. The Face of True Evil

My pursuit of power led me to two mentors who introduced me to hard-core, devil-worshipping Satanism.

- **Aquarius in Chicago:** A Voodoo hierophant, a Gnostic bishop, and—impossibly—a deacon in the Episcopal church, Aquarius taught me advanced black magick, sexual vampirism, and the art of traveling to other universes. He initiated me as a "priest of Lucifer" in a perverse Templar rite. A weekend spent in his apartment was one of the most terrifying experiences of my life. The living room was filled with demonic paintings whose eyes glowed in the dark; I watched in horror as they rearranged themselves on the walls while I tried to sleep.
- **Orion the Ipsissimus:** This biker-Satanist taught me the vilest of satanic doctrines. He explained that Christianity and Satanism had a symbiotic relationship. “The Christians were the sheep and we were the wolves,” he said. “For a Christian, the holiest act they can commit—is to die a martyr for the faith... For a Satanist, the holiest deed that they can do is murder a Christian.” With him, I participated in my first "Destruction ritual" to curse a man's ex-wife and was directly involved in helping that man create a pact with Satan, signed in his own blood.

#### 3.4. The Cathedral of Pain

My initiation into the highest levels of the Satanic brotherhood came not in a physical place, but in a visionary experience so real I could feel the grit in my eyes and the cold concrete on my back. I was led into a nine-sided temple whose walls were made of glass, behind which floated the preserved, mutilated bodies of hundreds of sacrificed victims—men, women, and a horrifying number of infants. On a blood-stained concrete altar, as robed figures chanted "Ave Satanas," a mark was placed upon me—a spiritual brand that signified I was Satan's personal property.

### 4. The Final Abyss: A Thirst for Blood

#### 4.1. The Vampire's Kiss

My involvement in the Gnostic Catholic church, a blend of Catholicism and Crowley's Satanism, was the doorway to my final descent: a vampire cult. I was taught that I was to assume the dark priesthood of the historical Vlad Dracula, who they viewed as a necessary "dark Christ." After a period of preparation involving injections of special herbs and drugs to transform my body, the final initiation took place in a windowless Orthodox chapel. There, I drank the blood directly from my mentor's veins to receive the demonic "virus" of vampirism.

#### 4.2. A Slave to the Craving

The consequences were immediate and terrifying. An uncontrollable craving for human blood consumed me. My appetite for normal food vanished, and my skin grew painfully sensitive to sunlight. I was trapped in an internal war against a monstrous, animalistic urge. Walking the streets, I had to physically fight the impulse to assault women, to pull them down like a predator attacking its prey. I was losing control, terrified of the monster I had willingly become.

### 5. The Long Road Home: A Glimmer of Hope

#### 5.1. A False Refuge

Desperate to escape the horror of vampirism, I remembered the advice of a former mentor: if I ever got into deep spiritual trouble, I should join the Mormon (LDS) church. Believing this was my only way out, my wife and I contacted Mormon missionaries. That night, I had a vivid dream where I stood on a stormy mountain peak, wielding flashes of lightning. Suddenly, the scene shifted, and I was walking down into a peaceful valley toward a small country church, from which I could hear the hymn "Amazing Grace." Tragically, I misinterpreted this dream. I believed it was God's blessing on my decision to become a Mormon, not realizing He was calling me to the true grace found only in Christ.

#### 5.2. The Seeds of Truth

Satan intended for Mormonism to be another cage, but God used it for His glory. For the first time in my life, I was part of a culture that emphasized righteous living. Though its foundation was the sand of a works-based salvation, the Lord in His mysterious grace used the Mormon obsession with outward holiness to finally force me to see the depth of my own inward corruption. More importantly, the Mormons encouraged the use of the King James Bible. As my wife, Sharon, read it, the Holy Spirit reawakened the true Christian faith she had accepted as a teenager before falling into the occult.

#### 5.3. An Act of Faith

Sharon was the key to my salvation. As her own faith grew, she began praying fervently for me. She realized that I was too enmeshed in my Mormon priesthood duties and occult contacts in Milwaukee to ever hear the truth. In a courageous act of faith, she arranged for us to move to another city, away from my entire support system. She trusted that God would use the isolation to break through my pride and deception.

### 6. Amazing Grace: My Conversion to Christ

#### 6.1. The Power of the Word

While researching for a book I was writing to defend Mormonism against Christianity, I stumbled across some Christian comics and tracts I had collected. Reading them, I felt a thrill of hope at the "Protestant version" of the gospel—it seemed too easy, too good to be true. I began an intensive, desperate study of the King James Bible, focusing on the Book of Romans. I had recently taken a commission sales job and was failing miserably, spending my days driving through the countryside between failed appointments. In that car, surrounded by professional failure and personal desperation, I read Romans again and again, praying for guidance and recalling my dream of "Amazing Grace." The truth finally shattered my defenses: salvation was not by works, priesthoods, or rituals, but by grace through faith in the finished work of Jesus Christ alone.

#### 6.2. The Prayer of a Sinner

The struggle was over. That night, I knelt at my bedside, confessed my sixteen years of horrific sin, renounced Satan and all his works, and asked Jesus Christ to forgive me and become my Lord and Savior. In that instant, all the fear, filth, and torment washed away. I was filled with a profound sense of peace and relief. For the first time, I was truly clean.

### 7. Dethroning the Darkness: Finding True Freedom

#### 7.1. Burning the Bridges

Soon after my conversion, the Holy Spirit convicted me that I could not hold onto my past. I had to destroy my massive collection of occult books, ritual tools, Masonic regalia, and priestly vestments—an arsenal of evil worth thousands of dollars. After several phone calls, I found a pastor willing to help. We loaded everything into his truck, took it to a safe location, and burned it all. As I watched the flames consume the symbols of my sixteen years in darkness, I felt a final, decisive break with the demonic world.

#### 7.2. The Process of Liberation

I quickly learned that salvation was an instantaneous event, but liberation was a process. Though I was a child of God, my soul was still bound by years of demonic covenants. The Lord led us to a church with an older pastoral couple experienced in spiritual warfare. They spent an entire evening with us, patiently and lovingly leading us through prayers of renunciation and deliverance. The key areas included:

1. **Satanism & Witchcraft:** Renouncing every oath, pact, blood covenant, and allegiance we had ever made to Satan, Lucifer, and the dozens of other deities we had served.
2. **Mormonism & Catholicism:** Renouncing the false Melchizedek and Aaronic priesthoods of Mormonism and the counterfeit priesthood of the Catholic Church.
3. **Spiritism & Mediumship:** Renouncing all contact with our "spirit guides," familiar spirits, and fetches by name, commanding them to leave us.
4. **Casting Out Spirits:** Finally, the pastoral couple ministered deliverance, casting out the unclean spirits that had held us in bondage for so long, all in the mighty name of Jesus.

### Conclusion: A Message of Hope

My story is a journey from the highest echelons of Satan's kingdom—a Gnostic bishop, a vampire, a Master Mason, and a High Priest of Satan—to the foot of the cross, saved only by the grace of God. It stands as a testament to an undeniable truth: no one is too far gone. No sin is too dark, no chain too strong for the grace of Jesus Christ. His power is not merely a force to be wielded, as I once believed; it is a love that pursues, a mercy that redeems, and a light that shines in the deepest abyss. If He could reach into the Cathedral of Pain to rescue a high priest of Satan, He can reach into any life, break any chain, and make any heart new.

## **An Exploration of Occult and Masonic Symbolism**

### Introduction: Navigating the Symbolic Landscape

This document serves as an educational guide for students new to the study of esoteric and fraternal orders. It will explore the symbolic meanings, historical claims, and core practices of Wicca, Satanism, and Freemasonry. The following analysis draws its conclusions and descriptions exclusively from the provided source materials, aiming to present the core arguments and claims therein with clarity and structure. The tone is explanatory, designed to demystify the complex web of beliefs and symbols as they are presented in the source texts.

### 1. The World of Witchcraft (Wicca)

#### 1.1. Defining the "Old Religion"

The source material describes Wicca, also known as "The Craft," as a modern religion manufactured in the 20th century. While it presents itself as an ancient, nature-worshipping faith, the texts posit that this is a fabrication. Its core appeal is characterized as being rooted in a blend of romance, idealism, and ecology, designed to attract those seeking a spiritual path outside of traditional faiths.

#### 1.2. The Dual Deities: Goddess and Horned God

Wicca is centered on the worship of two primary deities: a Great Mother Goddess and her consort, the Horned God. The source text describes them as follows, and the author's interpretation will later frame the Horned God as a key link to a unifying esoteric doctrine connecting all three groups.

| **The Great Mother Goddess**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | **The Horned God**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The Goddess is described as having three primary facets: the **Virgin** (representing new beginnings), the **Mother** (representing fertility and fullness), and the **Crone** (representing wisdom and death). She is known by many names across different cultures, including:<br> - Artemis<br>- Astarte<br>- Cerridwen<br>- Diana | The Horned God is presented as the consort of the Goddess, representing nature, virility, and the wild. The source text explicitly identifies this figure as a representation of Satan. He is known by names such as:<br>- Lucifer<br>- Cernunnos<br>- Pan |

#### 1.3. Core Beliefs and Moral Codes

The foundational tenets of Wiccan belief, as outlined in the source, include several key moral and metaphysical principles.

- **The Wiccan Rede:** This is the central ethical guideline of the faith, summarized by the phrase _"an it harm none, do what ye will."_ This principle suggests that Wiccans are free to act as they wish, so long as their actions cause no harm to others.
- **The Three-fold Law of Return:** This law dictates a form of karmic justice. The argument presented is that whatever energy a person sends out into the universe—whether positive or negative—will be returned to them three times over.
- **Reincarnation:** The belief in rebirth is a core doctrine. Actions in one life contribute to one's karma, which influences the circumstances of future lives.
- **Monism:** This is the philosophical belief that "All is One." It posits that every person, object, and force in the universe is an interconnected part of the divine God/Goddess.

#### 1.4. Key Rituals and Symbols

The source text highlights several key rituals and symbols that are central to Wiccan practice.

1. **The Magic Circle:** Before any ritual, a sacred circle is cast. This creates a space "placed between the worlds," which serves to either contain the magical power raised during a rite or to protect the participants from external influences.
2. **Sabbats and Esbats:** Wiccan holidays are divided into two categories. The **Sabbats** are eight major solar festivals that mark the changing of the seasons, such as Samhain (Halloween) and Beltaine (May Day). The **Esbats** are monthly feasts held during the full moon to honor the Goddess.
3. **Drawing Down the Moon:** This is described as a central and powerful ritual in which the High Priestess invokes the essence of the Great Mother Goddess into her own body. During this rite, she may go into a trance and speak as the Goddess.
4. **The Pentagram:** The five-pointed star is a primary symbol of Wicca. The source material makes a specific claim that an **inverted pentagram**, a symbol commonly associated with Satanism, is used to mark the Second Degree of the High Priesthood. As will be explored later, the text argues this symbol is a direct link to a broader esoteric tradition.

From the source's perspective on Wicca's hidden connections, it is a logical step to explore the more overt doctrines of Satanism.

### 2. The Doctrines of Satanism

#### 2.1. Levels of Satanic Belief

The source text outlines five distinct levels of Satanic belief, progressing from a symbolic philosophy to literal, demon-centric worship.

1. **Symbolic Satanism:** This level is primarily associated with Anton LaVey’s Church of Satan. Here, Satan is not a real being but a symbol of rebellion, self-indulgence, and opposition to traditional religious constraints. The philosophy is described as an atheistic "comic-opera Satanism."
2. **Misunderstood Hero:** At this level, followers believe Satan is a real entity but that he has been misunderstood. He is viewed as a "supernatural George Washington," a heroic rebel fighting against a tyrannical God for the freedom of humanity.
3. **Satan as a Counterpart to God:** This view reflects a Gnostic or dualistic perspective. It posits that Satan and Jesus are two sides of the same divine force, representing the necessary balance of darkness and light in the universe.
4. **The "Boot Camp for Gods":** This doctrine presents Hell not as a place of punishment but as a challenging training ground. Elite and rebellious souls are sent there to be forged into gods, with Satan acting as a drill sergeant.
5. **Literal Devil-Worship:** The final level involves direct worship of Satan and demons. Practices are said to include demon possession, sexual relations with demons, and human sacrifice, all with the belief that adherents will "reign" in Hell after death.

#### 2.2. Key Figures and Foundational Texts

The source identifies three central figures in the development of modern Satanism.

| Figure               | Affiliation / Title      | Core Contribution                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Aleister Crowley** | "The Great Beast 666"    | Author of _The Book of the Law_, which he claimed was dictated to him by a spirit guide named Aiwass. Aiwass is identified in the text as the Egyptian god Set. Crowley's religion is known as Thelema.                            |
| **Anton LaVey**      | Founder, Church of Satan | Author of _The Satanic Bible_, a book that at one time was reportedly "outselling the Bible on campuses around the country." He promoted an atheistic form of Satanism based on carnality and self-indulgence.                     |
| **Michael Aquino**   | Founder, Temple of Set   | A high-ranking member who left LaVey's church to worship a literal deity. He founded the Temple of Set and claims that Set revealed himself as the true being behind the Satan myth. Aquino also claims to be Crowley's successor. |

#### 2.3. The Nature of Satanic Rituals

The source describes two primary rituals used to cement a follower's commitment and direct magical power.

- **The Pact:** This is a formal ceremony in which an individual sells their soul to the devil. The agreement is often signed in the person's own blood and is made in exchange for earthly rewards such as power, fame, or wealth.
- **The Ritual of Destruction:** This is a practice of "psychic attack" or murder by cursing. It is a formal rite designed to bring about the demise of an enemy, in which deities such as "Oh Kali!," "Oh Sekhmet!," and "Oh mighty Dagon!" are invoked. A key line from this ritual is quoted as: _"I call upon the messengers of doom to slash with grim delight this victim I hath (sic) chosen."_

While Satanism is presented as overtly dark, the source alleges that a similar, though more veiled, symbolism can be found within the secret society of Freemasonry.

### 3. The Secrets of Freemasonry

#### 3.1. The Public Face vs. The Hidden God

According to the author's interpretation, Freemasonry presents itself publicly as a secular, charitable fraternity that promotes morality and brotherhood. Its members are taught to believe in a generic deity known as the "Great Architect of the Universe" (G.A.O.T.U.), allowing men of different faiths to join. However, the source text claims this is a facade for a hidden religious system. The central argument is that the true, composite name of the Masonic god is revealed only in the higher degrees, specifically the Royal Arch degree. This name is **JAH-BUL-ON**.

The source breaks down this name as a syncretic combination of three deities from different cultures:

- **JAH:** A shortened form of Jehovah, the God of the Bible.
- **BUL:** A name for Ba'al, the Canaanite fertility god frequently condemned in the Old Testament.
- **ON:** A name for Osiris, the Egyptian sun god and god of the underworld.

#### 3.2. Decoding the Blazing Star and Other Symbols

The source material posits that Masonic symbolism has dual meanings: an exoteric (public) meaning for lower-level members and an esoteric (hidden) meaning for high-level initiates.

**The Blazing Star** The source material identifies a central symbol in the Lodge as the Blazing Star, which is described as a pentagram. For the uninitiated, it is said to represent "Divine Providence." The argument presented, however, is that its true meaning is far different. The Blazing Star is alleged to be a symbol for the Dog-star, Sirius. The author's interpretation connects this to the occult traditions of ancient Egypt, where Sirius was the emblem of the god **Set**, whom the text identifies as Satan. The source will later argue that this symbol serves as a direct link to a unifying, esoteric doctrine.

##### **Other Core Symbols**

- **The Lambskin Apron:** While presented as a badge of honor, the source claims it is secretly a symbol of the "priesthood of Lucifer."
- **The All-Seeing Eye:** Publicly a symbol of the omnipresence of the Great Architect, the text frames this as a symbol of Illumination and "Lucifer-consciousness." It is identified as the "Ajna chakra" or "Third Eye," the "point of contact between humans and Lucifer-consciousness."
- **The Double-Headed Eagle:** A prominent symbol in the Scottish Rite, this is identified as the Phoenix. It is said to represent reincarnation and a form of resurrection that has no connection to Jesus Christ.

#### 3.3. The Power of Rituals and Oaths

The central legend of Freemasonry revolves around **Hiram Abiff**, the master builder of King Solomon's Temple. In the Masonic ritual, Hiram is murdered for refusing to reveal the master's secrets. He is later found and "raised" from the dead by King Solomon. The source frames this ritual as the Masonic equivalent of a resurrection and a counterfeit of the Christian experience of being Born Again. The theological reasoning offered is that this represents a works-based path to salvation, designed to replace the grace-based salvation offered through Jesus Christ.

Masonic oaths are described as being extremely serious and binding. They are sworn on the Bible and sealed with promises of gruesome physical penalties should the oath be violated. An example given is the promise to have one's body severed in two and disemboweled.

These three seemingly distinct traditions—Wicca, Satanism, and Freemasonry—are ultimately presented by the source as interconnected through a shared, hidden doctrine.

### 4. Synthesis: A Common Luciferian Thread

#### 4.1. The Unifying Doctrine

The primary thesis presented in the source material is that a "Luciferian doctrine" serves as the secret, unifying belief system connecting the highest echelons of Wicca, Satanism, and Freemasonry. This doctrine is concealed from lower-level initiates and the general public. The text supports this claim with a lengthy quote attributed to the high-level Masonic authority Albert Pike, which allegedly states: "...the true and pure philosophical religion is the belief in Lucifer, the equal of Adonay; **but Lucifer, God of Light and God of Good, is struggling for humanity against Adonay, the God of Darkness and Evil.**"

#### 4.2. Comparing Core Symbols Across Traditions

The pentagram serves as a powerful unifying symbol across these three traditions, though its name and specific application vary. The source's interpretation of this symbol in each context is detailed below.

| Tradition       | Symbol Name        | Symbolic Meaning and Use (According to the source)                                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Wicca**       | Pentagram          | A general symbol of the Craft. An **inverted pentagram** is used as the sign of the Second Degree of the High Priesthood.                                                    |
| **Freemasonry** | The Blazing Star   | A pentagram at the center of the Lodge representing "Divine Providence" to lower-level members, but secretly symbolizing the star Sirius, the emblem of the god Set (Satan). |
| **Satanism**    | Inverted Pentagram | The primary symbol of the faith, representing the Goat of Mendez (Baphomet). Used in the Church of Satan.                                                                    |

#### 4.3. An Alleged Historical Lineage

The source text presents a historical lineage for what it calls this "mystery religion," tracing its origins back to ancient Babylon and following its transmission through various secret societies over the centuries.

**Nimrod (Babylon)** -> **Ancient Mystery Religions (Egypt, etc.)** -> **The Knights Templar** -> **Modern Freemasonry**

### 5. Conclusion

This document has explored the core symbols, rituals, and beliefs of Wicca, Satanism, and Freemasonry as they are depicted in the source material. According to the texts, these seemingly disparate groups are not isolated phenomena but are secretly bound by a shared Luciferian philosophy. This underlying doctrine is said to be revealed progressively to higher-level initiates while being concealed behind a veil of public-facing symbolism and benign explanations. Key symbols like the pentagram, foundational myths involving a dying-and-rising god, and a dualistic worldview are presented as the common threads that weave these traditions together. The purpose of this exploration has been to demystify these alleged connections for the student, providing a structured overview based strictly on the claims and interpretations found within the provided texts.

## **Mechanisms of Indoctrination and Allegiance in Esoteric Societies: An Analysis of Personal Accounts**

### 1.0 Introduction

This paper provides a sociological analysis of the mechanisms of recruitment, indoctrination, and control within esoteric groups, drawing upon detailed personal accounts from a former member of organizations such as Freemasonry, Wicca, and various occult covens. While the study of high-demand groups often relies on external observation, first-person narratives offer a unique internal perspective on the systematic processes employed to secure and maintain member allegiance. By examining the reported techniques and rituals, this analysis deconstructs the architecture of social and psychological control that underpins these secretive fraternities.

The central thesis of this analysis is that such organizations utilize a multi-layered system of graduated entry, ritual conditioning, psychological manipulation, and hierarchical secrecy to systematically transform an individual's identity, secure unwavering allegiance, and enforce group cohesion. This process is not random but follows a deliberate and escalating methodology designed to dismantle a recruit's previous worldview and moral framework, replacing it with the group's own esoteric and hierarchical belief structure.

To explore this thesis, the paper is structured into four main sections. It begins by examining the initial pathways to entry, analyzing the recruitment strategies and graduated appeals used to engage potential members. It then delves into the architecture of indoctrination, focusing on the role of initiation rituals and psychological conditioning in reshaping identity. The third section analyzes the sociological structures of control that reinforce this conditioning, including hierarchical secrecy and the creation of intense interpersonal bonds. Finally, the paper investigates the function of transgressive rituals in cementing a member's commitment by requiring the violation of deeply held societal taboos, thereby completing the transformation process. This systematic journey begins, however, not with esoteric rites, but with carefully managed pathways of recruitment designed to draw the curious and the searching into the group's orbit.

### 2.0 Pathways to Entry: Recruitment and Initial Engagement

The recruitment phase is of strategic importance for any esoteric society, serving as the critical juncture where individuals are drawn from the broader society into the group’s sphere of influence. The personal accounts under review indicate that this process is seldom overt. Instead, it relies on sophisticated appeals to universal human desires—for knowledge, belonging, purpose, and power—often framed within benign or socially acceptable activities. This initial engagement serves to lower an individual's critical defenses and acclimate them to the group's culture before the more intensive indoctrination begins.

The initial appeal of these groups, as detailed in the source accounts, often stems from a fascination with the unknown and a search for spiritual alternatives to mainstream religion. A preoccupation with parapsychology, ghosts, haunted houses, and other unexplained phenomena is reported as a primary motivator for potential recruits. This curiosity about a reality beyond the mundane provides fertile ground for esoteric organizations, which promise to provide answers and access to hidden knowledge that conventional institutions fail to offer.

To capitalize on this interest, these organizations employ a strategy of graduated entry points, presenting a carefully curated public-facing identity that masks their deeper esoteric purposes.

- **Benevolent Presentation:** Reflecting on his time in Wicca, the author notes that organizations like it are presented as benevolent, nature-focused religions that appeal to modern sensibilities such as ecology and feminism. This framing as an accessible "white magic" tradition serves as an effective gateway, attracting individuals who are seeking spiritual fulfillment but would be repelled by overtly dark or satanic themes.
- **Secular Camouflage:** In a similar vein, Freemasonry is portrayed to the public and to new members as a secular, philanthropic fraternity—a "non-religion" dedicated to charity and brotherhood. This façade obscures the deeper religious and esoteric purpose that, according to the accounts, is only revealed to members as they advance through the higher degrees.
- **Youth "Feeder Programs":** The accounts describe the use of youth auxiliaries such as the Order of DeMolay, Job’s Daughters, and the Rainbow Girls. These organizations are reported to function as "feeder programs," normalizing the culture, symbols, and hierarchical structure of the parent organization for the next generation, thereby ensuring a steady influx of pre-conditioned recruits.

This strategy of graduated commitment ensures that individuals invest time and social capital based on a low-demand public persona, making subsequent disengagement more difficult when higher-demand esoteric content is later introduced. Through these carefully managed entry points, individuals are gradually introduced to the group's world, a process that transitions seamlessly from initial recruitment to the more intensive indoctrination that follows initiation.

### 3.0 The Architecture of Indoctrination: Ritual and Psychological Conditioning

Upon joining an esoteric society, the recruit is subjected to a systematic program of psychological conditioning designed to reshape their core identity, values, and allegiance. The primary vehicle for this transformation is ritual. Far from being mere ceremony, ritual in this context functions as a form of psycho-drama, creating powerful emotional and psychological states that render the individual more susceptible to the group's ideology. Through a combination of symbolic acts, gradual revelation of information, binding oaths, and the induction of altered states of consciousness, the individual's former self is methodically dismantled and a new, group-aligned identity is forged.

The initiation rite is the foundational ritual for this identity transformation. The accounts describe ceremonies employing elements designed to induce states of vulnerability and disorientation. The Masonic candidate, for example, is brought into the lodge blindfolded and bound with a "cable-tow" around his neck. Such acts, along with ritualized nudity and mock death-and-rebirth ceremonies (e.g., the raising of the candidate in the guise of Hiram Abiff), serve to disassociate the individual from their past self. By placing the initiate in a state of sensory deprivation and physical helplessness, the ritual strips away their autonomy and symbolically enacts their death to the outside world and rebirth into a new identity defined entirely by the group.

This process is reinforced through the mechanisms of "Gradual Revelation" and "Hermeneutic Control," where the meaning of the group's symbols and teachings is deliberately withheld and reinterpreted as the member advances. The accounts cite Masonic authority Albert Pike, who states that in the foundational Blue Lodge degrees, the initiate is _"intentionally misled by false interpretations."_ This "bait-and-switch" tactic ensures that lower-level members remain unaware of the true meaning of the symbolism they encounter. This hermeneutic control is exemplified by the re-symbolization of the "Blazing Star." Initially presented as "Divine Providence," the accounts claim it is later revealed to higher-degree Masons as Sirius, a star the author polemically links to the Egyptian god Set, thereby transforming a benign symbol into one laden with esoteric—and in the author's view, sinister—meaning. Another example from the author's time in Wicca is the inverted pentagram, a symbol widely associated with Satanism, which is reportedly revealed to be the secret sign of the Second Degree initiation.

The psychological commitment is further solidified through the swearing of blood oaths. Initiates swear these oaths on a sacred text, such as the Bible, under threat of gruesome physical penalties for disclosure. Pledging to suffer one's _"body severed in two and disemboweled"_ creates a profound psychological and spiritual bond. This mechanism leverages fear and the establishment of a sacred, unbreakable covenant to ensure secrecy and loyalty, binding the member not only to the group but also to a perceived supernatural enforcement of the oath.

Finally, the accounts detail the deliberate use of techniques to induce altered states of consciousness, which serve to break down mental defenses and increase suggestibility. Meditation practices described as _"stilling the mind"_ are presented as a technique to "vacate the mind so that someone or something else can use it." Hypnosis is identified as another key technique, which the author interprets as creating a "doorway for demonic access" believed to facilitate control by what are framed as external entities. Hallucinogenic drugs are described as _"powerful initiatic tools in Witchcraft"_ used to "'blow open' the 'Third Eye,'" which is framed in the source as a psychic center for contacting the spirit realm. These individual conditioning techniques are the building blocks of a new consciousness, which is then reinforced and sustained by the broader sociological structures of the group.

### 4.0 Sociological Structures of Control and Cohesion

Individual psychological conditioning, however potent, cannot be sustained without a social architecture designed to reinforce it. Esoteric societies support indoctrination with a carefully designed social structure that isolates members from external scrutiny, enforces conformity, and solidifies a powerful group identity. This framework ensures that the member’s newly forged allegiance is not challenged by outside perspectives and is continuously strengthened through intense, shared experiences within the closed system of the group.

Central to this social architecture is the hierarchical, "need-to-know" paradigm. The accounts describe these organizations as layered systems of _"secret orders within secret orders."_ This structure concentrates power and knowledge at the highest echelons, ensuring that lower-level members are prevented from understanding the organization's true nature and ultimate objectives. Rank-and-file members operate with a limited and often misleading interpretation of the group's purpose, a design that maintains control and prevents internal dissent.

To ensure cohesion, these groups focus on creating "soul ties" among members. This mechanism involves the formation of intense interpersonal bonds forged through shared, transgressive, and secret experiences, creating a form of "fictive kinship" and mutual compromise. The sources highlight the use of ritualized sexual practices, such as "sex magic" and Tantra, as a primary tool for creating these ties. These acts are used not only to generate altered states of consciousness but also to forge profound and compromising covenant links between participants. The shared secrets of these forbidden acts create a powerful form of trauma bonding; the intense, shared, and often negative experiences forge powerful group cohesion that isolates members from outside social networks and makes it psychologically difficult to leave without risking exposure.

Finally, a key strategy for maintaining control is to insulate the group from external society. This is reportedly achieved by systematically co-opting individuals within key societal institutions. The accounts describe a deliberate effort to recruit or corrupt members of law enforcement, the judiciary, and even funeral services. This network provides a protective buffer for the society, enabling it to prevent prosecution for illegal acts, ensure its secrets are maintained, and operate with a degree of immunity from conventional legal and social consequences. These sociological mechanisms create a closed, self-reinforcing environment where the member's transformed identity is protected and the group's ideology remains paramount, setting the stage for the final phases of indoctrination.

### 5.0 Advanced Indoctrination: The Transgression of Moral Boundaries

For an individual to become fully integrated into the esoteric society, their pre-existing moral framework must be systematically dismantled and replaced with one that aligns with the group's objectives. According to the personal accounts, this final stage of indoctrination is achieved through rituals that require the active transgression of deeply held societal and religious taboos. These acts serve as a psychological point of no return, severing the member's remaining ties to their former life and creating an unshakeable allegiance to the new group ideology.

A core technique in this process is described as "assimilating the shadow." Drawing from Jungian psychological concepts, initiates are taught to embrace their "personal darkness" and to philosophically unify good and evil within themselves. This doctrine functions to neutralize the conscience, reframing actions previously considered immoral as necessary steps toward wholeness and power. By accepting this worldview, the member is given a powerful rationale for abandoning conventional ethics and adopting the group's transgressive moral code.

This philosophical shift is cemented through participation in blasphemous rituals. The accounts provide examples such as the Templar initiation rite, which required the candidate to trample a crucifix, or rituals that involved a mockery of the Christian Last Supper. Performing an act that so violently contradicts one's prior moral code creates intense cognitive dissonance. To resolve this psychological discomfort, the individual must devalue their old belief system and inflate the importance of the new group, thereby justifying the transgressive act and cementing their new identity. This act becomes a "bridge-burning" event, making a return to their former social world psychologically untenable.

The culmination of this process often involves participation in blood sacrifice and ritual violence, described in the source as essential for "high art" magick. These acts serve several critical functions. They desensitize individuals to violence, create a powerful bond of shared trauma and guilt among participants, and solidify the member's rejection of conventional morality. The accounts offer a chilling rationalization for this moral inversion from a character identified as "Orion," who frames the murder of a Christian as the "holiest deed" for a Satanist. This act, he claims, creates a symbiotic relationship where "the Christians were the sheep and we were the wolves," illustrating the complete reversal of values that the indoctrination process aims to achieve. These transgressive acts represent the final and most crucial stage of the indoctrination process, creating a fully integrated and committed member whose identity and moral compass are irrevocably aligned with the esoteric society.

### 6.0 Conclusion

The personal accounts analyzed in this paper reveal a coherent and methodical system of indoctrination utilized by certain esoteric societies to secure the absolute allegiance of their members. The key findings demonstrate a process that begins with subtle recruitment and escalates through progressively more intense stages of psychological and sociological conditioning. The primary mechanisms identified include: graduated entry under benign pretenses; ritual-induced identity transformation through acts of vulnerability and symbolic rebirth; psychological manipulation via binding oaths and altered states; hermeneutic control through the deceptive revelation of secret knowledge; a hierarchical social structure that ensures secrecy and concentrates power; and the systematic transgression of moral boundaries to finalize the member's separation from mainstream society.

Revisiting the thesis, the evidence presented strongly supports the proposition that these organizations employ a sophisticated and deliberate system of control. The journey from an intrigued outsider to a committed initiate is not a matter of simple persuasion but the result of a multi-layered process designed to systematically deconstruct an individual's identity and reconstruct it within a new, closed, and esoteric framework. The consistency of these techniques across the different groups described in the accounts suggests a shared architecture of indoctrination, whether consciously adopted or functionally convergent.

This analysis contributes to a broader understanding of the dynamics of high-demand groups and secret societies by moving beyond a focus on their esoteric claims to illuminate the systematic processes at play. The accounts reveal how extraordinary claims of supernatural power and hidden knowledge are often built upon a sophisticated, and entirely human, architecture of social and psychological manipulation. By deconstructing this architecture of allegiance, we gain a clearer insight into the powerful forces that shape belief, identity, and behavior within the hidden worlds of these organizations.
