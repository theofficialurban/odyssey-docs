## **Incels, Terrorism & Extremism**

### _An Analysis of Terrorism_

Source Document[^1]

This academic thesis from the University of Central Florida, titled "An Analysis of Terrorism and Mental Health in Mass Shootings as Perceived by the Media," explores **how the media frames public mass shootings**. The author, Amairini Sanchez, investigates **the frequent use of "terrorism" and "mental health" as explanations** for these events in news reports. Through a content analysis of 75 mass shootings between 2007 and 2017, the study reveals that while mental health is the most common frame, **offenders identified as Muslim were consistently investigated for possible terrorism ties**, regardless of other contributing factors. The research highlights how media reporting can **distort public perception** of mass shootings and perpetuate stereotypes about minority groups and individuals with mental illnesses.

### _Predicting harm among incels (involuntary celibates)_

Source Document [^2]

This independent report from the Commission for Countering Extremism, authored by Joe Whittaker, William Costello, and Andrew G. Thomas, delves into the **complexities of the incel (involuntary celibate) subculture**. The study aims to understand factors that predict harmful attitudes and beliefs within this community, focusing on **mental health, ideological adherence, and social networking**. Through a large-scale survey of UK and US incels, the research provides insights into their demographics, prevalence of poor mental health and neurodiversity, shared worldviews (including identifying feminists as a primary enemy), and online communication patterns. Ultimately, <span class="text-yellow-300">the report highlights that **poor mental health and strong ideological belief are significantly more influential in predicting harm** among incels than the extent of their social networking.</span>

### _Don't Work for Soyciety_

Source Document [^3]

This academic article explores the **relationship between involuntary celibacy (inceldom) and unemployment or lack of engagement in education/training (NEET)**, a phenomenon observed at disproportionately high rates within incel communities. Through a thematic analysis of comments on a prominent incel forum, the authors found that many incels **promote unemployment as an ideological act of defiance against a society they believe has wronged them**, often labeling those who work as "fakecels." The study also uncovers how the "Blackpill" ideology, which attributes life success solely to physical appearance, extends to explain job market struggles and perceived discrimination, particularly from women in hiring roles. Furthermore, the research highlights that incels frequently report **experiences of bullying, social estrangement, and feelings of incompetence** in educational and work settings, sometimes linked to a high prevalence of neurodivergence like autism, suggesting that being NEET is both a chosen stance and a consequence of perceived or real marginalization.

### _The Angry Echo Chamber_

Source Document [^4]

This study, "The Angry Echo Chamber," investigates how the language and emotional expression of **involuntary celibates (incels)** evolve within their online forums. Researchers analyzed comments over a three-month period, focusing on **anger, sadness, and violent extremist language**. A key finding was that incels exhibit **higher levels of anger** compared to users on mainstream social media platforms, while sadness levels were comparable to some but lower than others. The study also revealed that incels often arrive at these forums already expressing significant anger and sadness, alongside **some use of extremist terminology**, which initially increases before leveling off. This suggests that the **radicalization process** might begin *before* joining an incel-specific forum, highlighting the need for earlier interventions on broader platforms.

### _Rage of Lonely Men_

Source Document [^5]

This academic article explores the profound connection between **loneliness** and **misogyny** within the online movement of involuntary celibates, or "incels." The authors highlight that incels frequently cite loneliness in their self-descriptions and in the manifestos of those who have committed violent acts, such as Elliot Rodger, to explain their violent behaviors and misogynistic attitudes. The study asserts that this pervasive loneliness, which encompasses intimate, relational, and societal exclusion, undergoes a transformation into antagonistic emotions like anger and hatred through a psychological defense mechanism called **ressentiment**. Ultimately, the article argues that while incel communities seemingly offer support, they paradoxically **exacerbate rather than alleviate** members' loneliness by reinforcing a narrow, rigid worldview and a cycle of social isolation rooted in misogynistic and often racist beliefs.

### _Western Women in Jihad_

Source Document [^6]

This comprehensive analysis, "Western Women in Jihad," explores the complex and often contradictory roles of women within jihadist movements, particularly ISIS. It challenges the simplistic view of women as mere victims, emphasizing their emergence as **voluntary political actors** with diverse motivations, from religious duty and a sense of belonging to a desire for adventure and an idealized marriage. While jihadist ideology largely confines women to **traditional roles as wives and mothers** within the private sphere, the study highlights a **growing tension between this conservative discourse and the aspirations of many Western female recruits** who seek more active, even violent, involvement. This internal conflict is evidenced by the strategic, yet often understated, creation of female brigades and the ongoing debate among ideologues regarding women's participation in combat and suicide attacks, revealing a pragmatic adaptability within these movements despite their deeply patriarchal foundations.

## **Mind Control & Criminal Hypnosis**

### _Programmed to Kill: The Politics of Serial Murder [David McGowan]_

Previous Deep Dive [^7]

This book, "Programmed to Kill: The Politics of Serial Murder," posits that many widely reported serial killer cases, rather than being the actions of lone deranged individuals, are actually **orchestrated events linked to covert operations, mind control, and organized criminal networks**. The author frequently highlights the **lack of consistent modus operandi** in alleged serial killer cases and points to **anomalies in investigations**, such as ignored evidence, witness tampering, and connections between alleged killers and law enforcement or intelligence agencies. The text also delves into alleged **pedophile networks and ritual abuse**, suggesting a deep-seated corruption within powerful institutions, with mind control techniques like those described by George Estabrooks and Paul Verdier used to create dissociative subjects who become unwitting assassins or patsies in larger schemes. Furthermore, the book implicates figures like Aleister Crowley, Jack Parsons, and the Process Church in the propagation of occult ideologies that may influence these criminal enterprises, concluding that powerful forces actively **manipulate and cover up these events** for various illicit gains, including drug and child trafficking.

### _Secret, Don't Tell: The Encyclopedia of Hypnosis [Carla Emery]_

(See also the [Timeline & Figures](https://docs.urbanodyssey.xyz/timelines/criminal-hypnosis.html) Article on this text)

Carla Emery's "Secret, Don't Tell: The Encyclopedia of Hypnotism" delves into the **history and mechanisms of hypnosis and mind control**, particularly emphasizing its **abusive and unethical applications**. The book highlights government involvement, especially by the CIA and NSA, in researching and developing mind-control technologies, including **narcohypnosis, personality splitting, and post-hypnotic suggestion** for purposes like creating "hypnoprogrammed assassins." Through various case studies, such as Zebediah, Mrs. E, Palle Hardwick, and Candy Jones, Emery illustrates how individuals can be manipulated, even to commit crimes, often with **induced amnesia** and the creation of **alternate personalities**. The text also explores the underlying physiological processes of trance and suggestibility, and details various induction methods and phenomena, while also touching on the difficulty victims face in gaining recognition and help due to widespread skepticism and institutional secrecy.

## **Propaganda**

### _Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media [Noam Chomsky]_

Source Document [^8]

This collection of excerpts critically examines the **propaganda model** as it applies to global and national media, asserting that mainstream news outlets predominantly **serve the interests of privileged groups and the state**. The text highlights the increasing **globalization and commercialization of media**, noting how this concentration of power influences reporting. It contrasts the extensive coverage given to "worthy victims" in adversarial states with the minimal attention paid to equally or more severe abuses committed by the U.S. government or its allies, particularly evident in its analysis of the **Vietnam War and conflicts in Central America** (El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua). Furthermore, the excerpts reveal how the media **actively suppress dissenting viewpoints and inconvenient facts**, often by manipulating narratives, ignoring critical sources, or even actively participating in disinformation campaigns, thus limiting public discourse and maintaining a narrow, pro-establishment framework.

### _Propaganda [Edward Bernays]_

Deep Dive Article [^9]

This document delves into the concept of **propaganda**, examining its pervasive influence on society. It suggests that an **unseen governance** subtly shapes public opinion and societal structures, orchestrated by a select few who understand the dynamics of mass psychology. The text asserts that **conscious manipulation** of public attitudes is a necessary tool for maintaining an organized and functioning society, guiding individuals who might otherwise be overwhelmed by complexity. Therefore, the purpose of propaganda, as presented, is to **systematize chaos** and maintain order through the strategic dissemination of information.

### _From PsyOp to MindWar [Michael Aquino]_

Deep Dive Article [^12]

This 1980 paper, "From PSYOP to MindWar: The Psychology of Victory," authored by Colonel Paul E. Valley and Major Michael A. Aquino, proposes a radical shift in **U.S. Army Psychological Operations (PSYOP)**. The authors argue that traditional PSYOP, focused on tactical persuasion and seen as a "force multiplier," failed in Vietnam because it was outmatched by enemy propaganda and relegated to an accessory role. Instead, they advocate for **"MindWar," a strategic approach that prioritizes psychological means** to achieve victory by **convincing the enemy to align their national policies with U.S. interests** using non-lethal methods. MindWar, distinct from propaganda, emphasizes **speaking a "whole truth" and projecting conviction** through powerful electronic media, even exploring the controversial use of natural phenomena like electromagnetic activity and ELF waves to enhance receptiveness to ideas. Ultimately, MindWar aims to win wars by dominating the "war for the mind" at national levels, with conventional warfare becoming a last resort.

### _CIA Guerrilla Warfare Manual_

Deep Dive [^13]

This source, "Psychological Operations in Guerrilla Warfare," functions as a **training manual for guerrilla forces**, specifically tailored for the "Christian and democratic crusade" of the Freedom Commandos in Nicaragua. Its central purpose is to outline methods for **manipulating public perception and gaining popular support** through both overt and covert psychological tactics, emphasizing that **guerrilla warfare is fundamentally a political war** where the "mind" of the populace is the primary target. The document details strategies ranging from **"armed propaganda"**, where visible armed presence aims to inspire trust rather than fear, to the **covert infiltration of "front organizations"** and the **orchestration of mass meetings** through "agitators" and "shock troops." A significant portion of the text focuses on developing the **"propagandist-combatant"**—a guerrilla whose political awareness and persuasive communication skills are as crucial as their fighting ability, ensuring they can justify their actions and ideology directly to the people.

## **Neuro-Linguistic Programming**

Neuro-Linguistic Programming Drive [^10]

### _NLP Essential Guide_

This PDF delves into Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), a methodology focused on understanding and **reshaping internal thought patterns and behaviors**. It explains how NLP offers **tools for personal change**, enabling individuals to identify and modify their "inner world" by altering mental images, sounds, and feelings. Key concepts include recognizing that **behind every behavior is a positive intention**, understanding how memories are customized and can be reframed, and using techniques like "anchoring" to access positive emotional states. Furthermore, the text explores how NLP principles can be applied to **improve communication and relationships** through techniques such as "mirroring" nonverbal cues, actively seeking missing information in conversations, and managing personal emotional states to foster better interactions. The ultimate goal is to empower individuals to **redesign themselves** and enhance their daily lives and interactions by consciously understanding and adjusting their cognitive processes.

### **_The Biology of Belief [Bruce Lipton]_**

This document comprises excerpts from "The Biology of Belief" by Dr. Bruce Lipton, a groundbreaking work that challenges the long-held belief in **genetic determinism**. Lipton, a former medical school professor, argues that our **genes are not our destiny**, but rather our **perceptions and beliefs, heavily influenced by environmental signals, control our biology**. The text explores this "New Biology" by drawing parallels between the intelligent behavior of single cells, where the cell membrane acts as the "brain," and the human body, emphasizing the profound impact of the **mind-body connection**. It delves into the science of epigenetics, the power of placebos and nocebos, and the critical role of **conscious parenting** in shaping a child's health and potential by reprogramming subconscious beliefs, ultimately advocating for a life driven by growth and love over fear and genetic fate.

## **Highlighted Example / Hypothetical Case Study**

::: tip

As a way to demonstrate this process, or at the very least make a point, we will use what I've come to call the "Incel Mark One" programming text, `The Catcher in the Rye` - This is a fitting text as there is no other that has been connected to so many assassins and extremists as is this book. From this analysis (by Thomas Wolfe), and my combination of sources and ultimately my article on "Incel Programming," you will understand why the book was considered influential by so many insane people.

> If you are one of those who can't help but wonder what in the world is happening to our communities right now, you should know that in part it is due to decades of spell casting that is starting to "come true” worldwide, including in the Middle East.
>
> To better illuminate how all these spells were, and are being, cast on you, we will use Jerome David Salinger's one hit book, "The Catcher in Rye" over three episodes.

This document offers a comprehensive look into J.D. Salinger's *The Catcher in the Rye*, focusing on its enduring **controversy and critical reception** as well as delving into key aspects of its narrative. The provided excerpts reveal the novel's initial condemnation for its **"offensive language" and "sexual content,"** yet acknowledge its massive sales and continued relevance to readers, suggesting a profound connection to protagonist Holden Caulfield's experiences. Character descriptions highlight **Holden's alienated perspective** and his relationships, particularly with his deceased brother Allie and his insightful younger sister Phoebe, who serve as anchors in his turbulent world. Finally, the selected passages from the novel itself showcase Holden's distinctive **colloquial voice and cynical observations** about "phoniness," his struggles with loneliness and the adult world, and his attempts to navigate a complex emotional landscape, all while hinting at the **redemptive power of innocence** as embodied by Phoebe.

### Wikipedia on Catcher's Connections to Assassins

:::danger Assassins Influenced by Catcher

Wikipedia Article [^11]

> _The best-known event associated with The Catcher in the Rye is arguably Mark David Chapman's murder of John Lennon in 1980. Chapman identified with the novel's narrator to the extent that he wanted to change his name to Holden Caulfield. On the night he shot Lennon, Chapman was found with a copy of the book in which he had written "This is my statement" and signed Holden's name. Later, he read a passage from the novel to address the court during his sentencing. Daniel Stashower speculated that Chapman had wanted Lennon's innocence to be preserved by death, inspired by Holden's wish to preserve children's innocence despite Holden's later realization that children should be left alone._
>
> _After John Hinckley Jr.'s assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan in 1981, police found The Catcher in the Rye in his hotel room. Hinckley's possession of the novel was later dismissed as an influence, as a half dozen various other types of books were also discovered in his possession._
>
> _Robert John Bardo, who murdered Rebecca Schaeffer, was carrying the book when he visited Schaeffer's apartment in Hollywood on July 18, 1989 and murdered her_
