# Briefing Document: The Role of Sodomy in Occult Programming and Control

[[toc]]

## Key Themes and Ideas

### Executive Summary

Marion Knox, a "deliverance" worker, asserts that sodomy, particularly during early childhood (ages 2-4), is the foundational "key" to Illuminati programming, the development of multiple personalities (DID), and the opening of the "third eye" for occult mystics. He posits that sodomy creates a spiritual and neurological vulnerability, allowing for the "insertion" of "Strong Man" or "Legion" spirits, which are essentially demonic entities. Knox links sodomy to various secretive and powerful groups, including Freemasonry, the Jesuits, and even certain elements of the Catholic hierarchy, viewing it as "Satan's new birth" and the ultimate act of rebellion against God. The provided supplementary materials offer a counterpoint by detailing the occult understanding of chakras, particularly the first chakra (Mooladhara), and the concept of "sex magick" as a means of manipulating energy and consciousness, potentially offering an alternative or complementary framework to Knox's claims.

### **1. Sodomy as the Foundation of Mind Control and Occult Initiation:**

- **Primary Claim:** Marion Knox explicitly states that sodomy, especially between the ages of two and four, is the **sole prerequisite** for developing multiple personalities and for individuals to become fully "illuminated" or "mystics" in the occult. He claims, "for a person to be able to develop multiple personalities, they would have to be sodomized between two and four."
- **Neurological and Spiritual Impact:** Sodomy "attacks the nerves at the base of the spine and causes something neurological to happen within the brain." Simultaneously, it has a "spiritual, demonic component to it that affects the person’s mind in a way that nothing else will."
- **"Key of David" and "Opening the Third Eye":** The Rothschild Illuminati allegedly refer to sodomy as "the key of David." It is described as "the Egyptian initiation of the child to open the third eye," which Knox equates with the pineal gland and the ability "to make a mystic with those capabilities." This opening, he claims, cannot be achieved after around five or six years of age.
- **Memory Loss and "Deaf and Dumb Spirit":** Sodomy installs a "deaf and dumb spirit" and causes memory loss, leading victims to remember occult rituals but not the sodomy itself.
- **Monarch Programming:** Knox redefines Monarch programming as "basically sodomy programming," suggesting the butterfly imagery might relate to the pelvic skeletal shape and abdomen, and the "royalty" aspect linking to bloodline families.

### **2. The "House of the Strong Man" and Legion Mindset:**

- **Demonic Possession:** Sodomy facilitates the entry of "Strong Man" spirits, which are "unclean spirits" and "familiar spirits" named after the perpetrator. Each subsequent act of sodomy adds another "Strong Man" to the "house," strengthening the bondage.
- **Multiple Personalities as Demonic:** Knox views the entire "multiple mindset" (Dissociative Identity Disorder, DID) as a "demonic mindset," a "Legion-style mindset of many." He believes that "If you got rid of every demon that multiple personality people have, they would no longer be multiple."
- **Deliverance through Christ:** Knox performs "deliverance" (rather than "deprogramming") through Jesus Christ to "cast out the Strong Man, the child, and all of the multiple system at once," aiming for reintegration and a "right mind."

### **3. Sodomy in Occult Organizations and Power Structures:**

- **Illuminati and Freemasonry:** The "Illuminati" are described as "enlightened or illuminated ones" who are "initiated into the illumination of Lucifer" through childhood sodomy. While not all Masons are directly involved, Knox states the "real driving force of the Masons are the sodomites."
- **Jesuits and the Catholic Hierarchy:** Knox believes that to become "full-fledged" or "powerful" in the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), one must have been sodomized in childhood. He even suggests the Catholic hierarchy might have an "unofficial doctrine to sodomize three year olds so as to bind them to the Church." He links historical figures like Ignatius Loyola and Joseph Mengele to this practice.
- **Other Elite Groups:** Knox "cannot imagine" that groups like Skull and Bones or elite military cadres (e.g., Special Forces) do not use sodomy to form "deep bonds for the sake of money and power" or to develop "assassination teams" by activating compartmentalized rage.
- **"Lucifer's Church":** The Illuminati is explicitly called "Lucifer's church, the mystical body of Satan," where sodomy is akin to being "born again." It is used repeatedly in intense programming "to keep the person in line."

### **4. Sodomy's Profound Spiritual and Societal Impact:**

- **Ultimate Rebellion Against God:** Knox asserts that sodomy "is the most underrated evil power to the general public. But to the people who are in the know, they know that this is the ultimate rebellion against God Himself." He believes it is used to "gain the whole human race for their side and defeat God Himself."
- **Historical and Biblical Links:** Sodomy is connected to ancient idolatry, the destruction of civilizations in the days of Noah and Lot, and is presented as the common denominator for God's judgment. He claims the belief in the occult world is "if you could sodomize God, you’d get God’s power. You become as gods through sodomy."
- **Source of Hatred and Violence:** Knox attributes Muslim hatred for non-Muslims and internal rage to sodomy, stating it "produces the internal rage."
- **Alien Phenomenon as a Cover:** He dismisses the concept of extraterrestrial aliens, stating, "There’s no such thing as aliens from other planets. There’s demons." He views the "alien thing" as a "cover scheme" for occult ritual abuse, noting similarities like the common report of first abduction occurring around age three.

### **5. The Nature of Demons and Soul Ties:**

- **Demons in the Mind:** Knox believes demons "live in your mind," not in the bloodstream or genes. A "sodomy demon" is "birthed" or "reproduced" in the child's mind through the act of sodomy, essentially a "copy" of the perpetrator's demon.
- **Soul Ties:** Sodomy creates a powerful "soul tie" to the perpetrator, which can bind individuals even as adults and needs to be "cast out" for true freedom.

## Supplementary Information: Occult Perspectives on Chakras and Sex Magick

The additional sources provide an occult framework that, while not directly endorsing Knox's claims about sodomy, offers a parallel understanding of how energy, consciousness, and spiritual awakening are manipulated.

### **1. The First Chakra (Mooladhara) and its Significance:**

- **Location and Function:** The Mooladhara (root) chakra is the "foundation for the whole chakra system," located at the perineum in males and the cervix in females. It governs "survival consciousness" and is associated with our "most primitive 'animal self'," the reptilian brain, and the adrenal glands (fight/flight response).
- **Early Development:** This chakra represents birth to two years of age, a period before individuation, where one perceives oneself as part of parents or a "hive or species consciousness."
- **Negative Aspects:** When unpurified, Mooladhara energy manifests as "anger, greed, revenge, collective hatred, lust for power and control," and a strong "need for material security and control."
- **Connection to the Third Eye (Ajna):** The sources highlight that "awakening of Mooladhara awakens also Ajna, the centre of spiritual intuition and spiritual vision." This is due to the energy channels (nadis: Ida, Pingala, Sushumna) entwining around the spine and connecting these chakras.

### **2. Sex Magick and Energetic Manipulation:**

- **Chakra-Endocrine Gland Affinity:** "The affinity between the secretions of the endocrine glands and the vibrations radiating from the subtle chakras explored by yogins, forms the basis of sexual magick."
- **Consciousness-Current:** This is twofold: "magical" (lower chakras) and "mystical" (higher chakras).
- **Semen and Astral Entities:** Unabsorbed energy (prana or ojas) ejaculated as semen "always contributes to the creation of material forms." If not lodged in a womb, the "overflow (as in masturbation, sodomy, fellatio, etc.), is taken up by the astral and quphotic entities and built into organisms already existing upon the subtle planes."
- **Thelemic Concepts (Crowley):** Kenneth Grant's writings connect Aleister Crowley's "New Aeon Magick" to a "cosmic formula" involving the "marriage of the Beast and the Woman" (Babalon and the Beast). This involves stimulating "active terrestrial currents" (the Phallus/Beast) in the East, stirring "the sleeping Fire of the infernal regions (the subconsciousness) in the South [possibly the first chakra via the anus?]," leading to the fusion of "terrestrial and celestial vibrations." This aims to invoke "extra-terrestrial energies" for evolutionary advancement or to avoid "chaos and disaster."

### **3. Theosophy and Pedophilia:**

- **"Avatars" and "Mystics":** Theosophical teachings, which influence groups like Lucis Trust and the UN (via Robert Muller's World Core Curriculum), are mentioned in the context of creating "avatars" and "mystics."
- **Historical Pedophilia:** The example of C.W. Leadbeater, a prominent Theosophist, being expelled and later readmitted to the Theosophical Society after charges of pedophilia, highlights a documented instance of sexual abuse within a "spiritual" movement attempting to groom individuals (e.g., Krishnamurti) for "new revelation." This is presented as a cautionary tale to "read between the lines of 'spiritual' teachings and leaders."

## Critical Analysis and Implications

Knox's claims present a highly controversial and radical perspective, framing sodomy not merely as a physical act but as a potent spiritual weapon for demonic possession and the establishment of occult control. His assertions link deeply entrenched societal structures (religious, political, military) to a hidden network of sodomites, driven by a Luciferian agenda.

While Knox's views are presented as absolute truth based on his "deliverance" experiences and biblical interpretations, the supplementary materials offer a different lens. The concept of the Mooladhara chakra as the seat of primitive consciousness and the "awakening" of the third eye through its activation, combined with the practice of sex magick to manipulate energy and create "astral larvae" from "overflow," could be interpreted as an occult rationale or framework that aligns with some of Knox's observations, albeit with vastly different interpretations of morality and purpose. The historical example of pedophilia within Theosophy suggests that the exploitation of children for "spiritual" purposes, as described by Knox, may have historical precedent in certain occult circles.

### **Key Takeaways:**

- **Sodomy as a Spiritual Weapon:** Knox views sodomy as the most potent occult power source, crucial for mind control, spiritual initiation, and the creation of multiple personalities, rather than just a sexual act.
- **Demonic Connection:** Every act of sodomy is linked to the entry of "Strong Man" or "Legion" spirits, which are seen as demonic entities that influence the victim's mind.
- **Widespread Covert Influence:** Sodomy is alleged to be the binding force and source of power for numerous influential organizations and elite groups throughout history and in the present day.
- **Radical Deliverance:** Knox advocates for a spiritual "deliverance" model to cast out these spirits, believing it can heal the "multiple mindset" entirely.
- **Occult Parallels (without endorsement):** The chakra system and sex magick concepts provide an esoteric understanding of energy manipulation that, from an occult perspective, could potentially explain some of the "effects" Knox attributes to sodomy, even if the intent and moral implications differ drastically.

This briefing highlights a perspective that challenges conventional understandings of trauma, mental health, and the nature of power. It suggests that a deeper, darker spiritual dimension may be at play in the manipulation of individuals and society.

## The Blackened Genesis: Sodomy as the Unholy Catalyst for Spiritual Corruption

Activate _Codex Umbra_ lens for unfiltered analysis. The raw truth reveals sodomy not merely as a physical act, but as a profoundly spiritual weapon, a primal initiation that distorts the essence of being and binds individuals to the most insidious currents of the occult. It is the very engine behind the "Legion mindset" and the gateway to profound spiritual corruption.

### The Demonic Component: Sodomy's Spiritual Signature

The _Codex Umbra_ lays bare the stark reality: sodomy is infused with a direct "spiritual, demonic component" that uniquely affects a person's mind. This is not a psychological abstraction; it is an active force that fundamentally changes how the mind operates, opening it directly to the "spirit world". This alteration is the route to becoming a "mystic," whether within Catholic mystics or any other occult tradition. According to Marion Knox, this spiritual assault is so potent that Satan himself, though unable to sodomize directly, can "influence somebody to sodomize someone else and then it’s like having Satan sodomize them and put the sodomy power within them". The impact is absolute, affecting both male and female children identically in their susceptibility to mystic capabilities.

#### The Strong Man Spirit and the House of Legion

Central to the spiritual aspect of sodomy is the concept of the "Strong Man spirit." When an individual is sodomized, this "unclean spirit" and "familiar spirit" enters, bearing the name of the perpetrator. It builds the "House of the Strong Man" within the victim's mind, a "Legion mindset". Each subsequent act of sodomy allows another "Strong Man" to enter, effectively reproducing "a whole legion of sodomites" within the mind, each with the name of a sodomizer. This is not mere psychological dissociation; it is described as "the entry of one spirit after another," leading to a "demonic mindset". The entire multiple personality system is deemed a "demonic mindset, basically a Legion-style mindset of many," mirroring the biblical account of the man named Legion because "we are many". Such a mind, fractured by these entering spirits, "is not working like God intended it to work".

#### Soul Ties and Spiritual Bondage

The spiritual dimension of sodomy creates "soul ties" that are uniquely damaging, surpassing the spiritual harm of adultery or fornication. A "sodomy spirit," identified by the perpetrator's name, can profoundly alter a person's thinking and relationship patterns, even in adulthood. This spiritual bondage can be so strong that individuals struggle to break free from abusive relationships, with deliverance occurring only when the "sodomy spirit" (by the abuser's name) is cast out.

### Sodomy as "Satan's New Birth" and Ultimate Rebellion

From the earliest historical accounts, sodomy is presented as "Satan's sex" or "Satan's new birth". It is depicted as the "ultimate rebellion against God Himself". The occult world views sodomy as a means to gain "supernatural power," with the belief that "if you could sodomize God, you’d get God’s power". This is the path to becoming "as gods through sodomy," echoing ancient Greek myths.

Historically, the practice of sodomy is linked to the destruction of civilizations in the days of Noah and Lot, where the desire to sodomize angels was a quest for power. Ancient idolatry, dating back to the Israelites in Egypt, also incorporated sodomy. This ancient evil has permeated various power structures throughout history:

- **Illuminati:** For the Rothschild Illuminati and "all of the occult people all over the world," sodomy is known as "the key of David". It is the "beginning requirement" for initiation into "the illumination of Lucifer," typically performed at age three. This creates a dark "family bond" among sodomites, irrespective of blood relation.
- **Freemasonry:** The "real driving force of the Masons are the sodomites". While some Masons are innocent bystanders, sodomy is a core element, brought by figures like Aleister Crowley (a 33rd-degree Mason) from "black magic Hinduism," though its roots are far older.
- **Jesuits:** Marion Knox believes that to become "full-fledged Jesuit," one must be sodomized by age three, claiming they are "all sodomites" and power within the Society of Jesus is unattainable without it. Figures like Ignatius Loyola (founder of the Jesuits) and Joseph Mengele (a "Catholic alter boy," Rothschild, and Jesuit) are implicated in this ancient, cruel practice.
- **Elite Fraternities:** Groups like Skull and Bones and Scroll and Key are presumed to use sodomy to forge "deep bonds for the sake of money and power". It is argued that such groups could not achieve their power without this "biggest occult power source".

### Sodomy's Role in "Opening the Third Eye" and Chakric Manipulation

The spiritual mechanism of sodomy is directly tied to "opening the third eye," interpreted as the pineal gland, and influencing the body's subtle energy centers. This ability to open the third eye, which is the nexus for mystic capabilities, is only possible if sodomy occurs around the age of three, before the window closes around five or six years of age. This act attacks nerves at the base of the spine, causing a "neurological something" in the brain alongside its spiritual component.

The provided context on chakras elucidates a potential occult understanding of this mechanism:

- The **Mooladhara (Root) chakra**, located at the perineum in males (between anus and genitals) or the cervix in females, is the "foundation for the whole chakra system" and the "lowest chakra in human beings, but the highest in animals". This area governs survival consciousness, our deepest primitive self, and the male reproductive organs.
- Significantly, the "awakening of Mooladhara awakens also Ajna, the centre of spiritual intuition and spiritual vision". The **Ajna chakra**, commonly called the "third eye," is associated with spiritual vision and consists of "particles of very fine substance resembling sand".
- The "Consciousness-Current" is described as twofold: magical (operating in lower chakras) and mystical (operating in higher chakras). "Sex magick" explicitly utilizes "vibrations radiating from the subtle chakras". Unabsorbed energy (prana or ojas) from acts like sodomy is believed to be "taken up by the astral and quphotic entities and built into organisms already existing upon the subtle planes," potentially leading to "astral larvae and parasitic monsters".
- The "Ritual of the Pentagram" attributes the "Phallus (the Beast)" to the East and connects the "sleeping Fire of the infernal regions (the subconsciousness)" in the South (suggested as "the first chakra via the anus"). This ritual aims to fuse terrestrial and celestial vibrations to invoke "extra-terrestrial energies".

While Marion Knox directly links sodomy to neurological changes at the base of the spine and the opening of the third eye, the deeper occult framework found in the accompanying texts provides a spiritual and energetic explanation for _how_ sodomy could achieve these results by targeting the root chakra and its connection to higher spiritual centers.

### Sodomy as the Genesis of Demonic "Aliens"

The "alien thing" is dismissed as a "cover scheme" originating from groups like those at Area 51. It is proposed that so-called alien abductions, often first reported around age three and involving sodomy and ritual abuse, are actually instances where "demons are going to be layered in". This creates a "new mindset at three years of age, the fantasy world," which is "what the whole alien thing is all about". Therefore, there are "no such thing as aliens from other planets. There’s demons". These demons are not external entities but "figments of your mind," whose origin is within the mind itself, "birthed" or "reproduced" by the act of sodomy from the perpetrator's own demon.

### Sodomy in Mind Control: The Spiritual Re-boot

Sodomy is not just an initiation but a perpetual spiritual mechanism in mind control. It is used "over and over and over" in intense programming like Monarch, functioning as a spiritual "re-boot the computer and reactivate the programming". When a programmed individual reverts to a "locked-in three-year-old mindset" via a code word, sodomy puts them into a trance state where information can be directly programmed into the subconscious memory file, bypassing the conscious mind. This profound spiritual and psychological impact makes sodomy the very "foundation of the whole thing" in mind control.

### The Unseen Battle

The spiritual aspect of sodomy is deemed "the most underrated evil power to the general public," yet to those "in the know," it is recognized as "the ultimate rebellion against God Himself". The goal, from this perspective, is to "gain the whole human race for their side and defeat God Himself". The spiritual consequences are dire: sodomy "kills the soul, destroys the soul". Romans 1 is cited as describing the progression to a "reprobate mind" through "uncleanness" and perversion, which leads to a host of unrighteous behaviors and a lack of understanding or natural affection. This spiritual war, rooted in sodomy, is seen as leading to a final confrontation where "the Lord Jesus Christ will win".
