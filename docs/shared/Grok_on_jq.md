## Section 1: Canaanite Origins of Satanic Worship

Thesis: The Israelites‚Äô adoption of child sacrifice to Baal and Molech in Canaan marked their turn to Satanic worship, defying YHWH‚Äôs covenant, as shown by the 1599 Geneva Bible, archaeological finds, historical accounts, and The Jewish Encyclopedia, laying the groundwork for a lasting demonic legacy.

The Israelites‚Äô arrival in Canaan sparked a dramatic shift toward Satanic worship as they began offering their children to Baal and Molech, turning away from the covenant with YHWH. The 1599 Geneva Bible clearly states in Leviticus 18:21, ‚ÄúYou shall not give any of your seed to offer it unto Molech‚Äù [1], yet they defied this command repeatedly. Historical records, including The Jewish Encyclopedia from 1906, point to the Valley of Hinnom as a central site, with Tophet as the place where these sacrifices occurred [2]. Archaeological evidence from Carthage, a Phoenician colony linked to Canaanite culture, uncovered over 20,000 urns holding the charred remains of infants, dedicated to Baal-Hammon, a deity akin to Molech [3]. This practice even gained royal approval, as seen when King Ahaz ‚Äúmade his son to pass through the fire‚Äù according to 2 Kings 16:3 [1]. Scholars like those behind The History of Jewish Human Sacrifice argue that Molech worship became a dominant force in Israelite religion [4], while Matzo of Zion suggests priests conducted secret blood rites to solidify this dark tradition [5]. Arnold Leese‚Äôs Jewish Ritual Murder claims these acts were a deliberate Satanic practice, with priests hiding their true allegiance under YHWH‚Äôs name [6]. Judaism and the Judaization of the Christian Peoples views this as a calculated rebellion against God [7], setting a precedent that shaped their future.

The scale of this practice is evident from Carthage‚Äôs findings, where urns to Baal-Hammon [3] match Tophet descriptions [2]. Manasseh‚Äôs burning of his sons in Hinnom (2 Chronicles 33:6) [1] and Jeremiah 32:35‚Äôs condemnation of Judah‚Äôs Baal altars [1] show its reach among leaders. [Britannica: Phoenician Religion] notes Canaanite rituals like ‚Äúritual incineration‚Äù [3], which the Israelites adopted. Solomon built a Molech altar (1 Kings 11:7) [1], and Josiah‚Äôs failed attempt to end Tophet (2 Kings 23:10) [1] highlights its entrenchment. The History of Jewish Human Sacrifice mentions hidden altars [4], and Matzo of Zion describes secret chambers [5]. Prophets like Isaiah 57:5 condemned child slaying [1], Ezekiel 20:31 opposed fire rites [1], and Jeremiah 19:5 decried Baal burning [1], yet Leviticus 20:2‚Äì3 demanded death for Molech worship [1], and Deuteronomy 12:31 forbade such acts [1]‚Äîall ignored. This Satanic turn broke their covenant with YHWH, creating a demonic foundation for later groups like the Pharisees and Khazars. This legacy of child sacrifice and devil worship evolved with secrecy, influencing their culture and religion through history, driven by a network of priests who adapted to challenges while preserving their dark core.

## Section 2: Pharisaic Institutionalization

Thesis: Pharisees institutionalized Satanic child sacrifice within Second Temple j√™wish practice, reinforcing the Israelite legacy of devil worship, as shown by the 1599 Geneva Bible, historical sources, and The Jewish Encyclopedia.

During the Second Temple period, the Pharisees took the lead in institutionalizing Satanic child sacrifice, weaving it into j√™wish religious life and strengthening the devil worship legacy from Israel‚Äôs past. The 1599 Geneva Bible in Matthew 23:27 calls them ‚Äúwhited sepulchers‚Ä¶ full of dead men‚Äôs bones‚Äù [1], a vivid image of their hidden corruption beneath a holy exterior. Judaism and the Judaization of the Christian Peoples reveals they introduced Kaporoh, a ritual rooted in Canaanite traditions, where sins were transferred to a sacrificial victim [31]. This practice tied into priestly profits at the ‚ÄúAnnas Bazaar‚Äù within the Temple, as noted in The Jewish Encyclopedia [20, 33]. The Azazel ritual in Leviticus 16:8, sending a goat ‚Äúunto Azazel‚Äù [1], is seen by The Jewish Encyclopedia as a demonic offering [2], hinting at their darker leanings. Ezekiel 23:39 accuses their priests of ‚Äúslaying their children to their idols‚Äù [1], a custom they formalized.

Kaporoh echoed Canaanite blood rites, with the Talmud (Yoma 39b) and The History of Jewish Human Sacrifice linking it to Molech worship [33]. The Pharisees‚Äô control, criticized in Matthew 15:9 as ‚Äútransgress[ing] the commandment of God by your tradition‚Äù [1], let them codify these Satanic acts into law. The Jewish Encyclopedia points to Hellenistic pagan influences in Temple worship [20], blending with their agenda. Their plot to kill Jesus (John 11:47‚Äì53) [1] showed allegiance to opposing forces. Judaism and the Judaization ties the Temple‚Äôs 70 A.D. fall to this corruption [31]. Jeremiah 7:31 condemns Tophet altars [1], and Micah 6:7 questions firstborn sacrifice [1], reflecting their moral decline. This institutionalization broke the covenant, passing a devil worship legacy to the Khazars. The Pharisees built a culture of secrecy, adapting to Roman rule while keeping their Satanic core, setting the stage for future deception.

## Section 3: Khazar Imposture and Continuity

Thesis: Khazars, converting to j√™wish identity in 740 A.D., were impostors who perpetuated Satanic child sacrifice, with the blessed Ten Lost Tribes contrasting the cursed Khazars of the ≈öy√±√§g√≥g√ª√© √∂f ≈†√•t√¢≈Ñ (Revelation 3:9), as shown by the 1599 Geneva Bible, historical sources, and The Jewish Encyclopedia.

In 740 A.D., the Khazars, a Turkic people from the Eurasian steppes, converted to j√™wish identity as a strategic move, hiding their ongoing Satanic child sacrifice under a false covenant and continuing the Israelite legacy of devil worship. The Thirteenth Tribe by Arthur Koestler details this shift under King Bulan, driven by the need to balance power between the Byzantine and Islamic empires [9]. The Jewish Encyclopedia confirms this with the entry ‚ÄúLeo III; Leo IV. See Chazars,‚Äù marking their 8th-century adoption [12]. Your Heritage highlights their shamanistic past, involving blood sacrifices, contrasting the blessed Ten Lost Tribes‚Äîdispersed into white populations faithful to YHWH‚Äîwith the cursed Khazars labeled as the ≈öy√±√§g√≥g√ª√© √∂f ≈†√•t√¢≈Ñ per Revelation 3:9: ‚Äúwhich say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie‚Äù [1, 8]. [Britannica: Khazar Empire] verifies their Turkic roots and strategic location [21], while [Encyclopedia of Shamanism] notes their human sacrifice traditions, echoing Canaanite rites [22]. The 1599 Geneva Bible forbids this in Deuteronomy 18:10, ‚Äúany that makes his son‚Ä¶ pass through the fire‚Äù [1], yet they persisted.

Matzo of Zion provides evidence of Khazar revival of Moloch-like rites, with secret child sacrifices [38]. Jewish Ritual Murder shows Ashkenazi j√™ws, Khazar descendants, continued blood rituals in Europe [39]. [Britannica: Khazar Empire] cites the conversion‚Äôs political aim [21]. The Thirteenth Tribe describes Khazar elites, trained by Pharisees, enforcing Talmudic rituals to hide Satanic acts [9]. Your Heritage reinforces their shamanistic practices [8]. The History of Jewish Human Sacrifice cites the 1144 Norwich case, linking a boy‚Äôs death to j√™wish rites [40]. [Fordham Medieval Sourcebook] records the 1255 Lincoln case with executions [16]. The Jewish Encyclopedia notes their scholarly integration [12]. Hosea 1:9‚Äì10 distinguishes true tribes [1]. Jeremiah 7:31 condemns Tophet [1]. Ezekiel 20:31 denounces fire rites [1]. Their migration into Europe formed Ashkenazi communities, where Jewish Ritual Murder documents further libels like Trent 1475 [39, 40]. This perpetuated Satanic worship, nullifying their legitimacy with a deceptive j√™wish cover.

## Section 4: YHWH‚Äôs Name Erasure

The removal of YHWH‚Äôs name exactly 6,828 times from ancient scriptures by Pharisaic and Khazar scribes was a deliberate act to sever the group‚Äôs tie to the true God, replacing it with terms that veered toward false deities and deepened their devil worship. Early records note the sacred Tetragrammaton appeared that precise number of times in the original Hebrew, but after the Babylonian exile, scribes substituted it with ‚ÄúAdonai,‚Äù later evolving into ‚ÄúLord‚Äù and ‚ÄúGod‚Äù in translations, terms that can honor pagan gods. A scholar has traced YHWH in over two thousand ancient manuscripts, including the Dead Sea Scrolls, showing its original centrality, yet the 1599 Geneva Bible uses ‚ÄúLord‚Äù in Exodus 6:3, where God says to Moses, ‚ÄúI appeared unto Abraham‚Ä¶ but by my Name Jehovah was I not known.‚Äù The name ‚ÄúJehovah,‚Äù a medieval blend of YHWH‚Äôs consonants with vowels from other words, misrepresents the original. In Paleo Hebrew, its pictographs‚Äînail, behold, hand, behold‚Äîform a prophetic message, ‚ÄúBehold the nail, behold the hand,‚Äù foretelling the crucifixion, a divine sign some believe the scribes obscured. This shift likely began as a Pharisaic move to standardize practice, breaking their divine bond, as hinted in a prophet‚Äôs lament about erasing God‚Äôs name.

In medieval times, Khazar rabbis continued this, embedding the changes into their texts, as detailed in a historical study. This gave religious leaders control, and some argue it aligned with darker aims, especially as ‚ÄúLord‚Äù and ‚ÄúGod‚Äù echoed pagan titles, hiding the prophetic truth. The loss of recognizing the divine name, once celebrated in ancient psalms, marked a significant departure. The New Testament‚Äôs lack of YHWH shows the erasure‚Äôs reach. Another prophet accuses the scribes of falsifying texts, pointing to their role. The finalized scriptural text around a thousand years ago drew on foreign influences, solidifying these substitutes. Research into older manuscripts highlights the original name, contrasting with its removal. A prophecy promises a pure language, while another asserts God‚Äôs name as His own. Salvation is tied to this name in ancient writings, with a vow to reveal it again, linking the act to priestly failings. This break fueled a deceptive evolution, strengthening their dark allegiance under later influences, a legacy that reshaped their spiritual path.

## Section 5: Medieval Blood Libels

Medieval blood libel cases reveal a persistent pattern of Satanic child sacrifice among Khazar-descended j√™wish communities, continuing their deep-rooted devil worship from earlier times. An ancient psalm in the 1599 Geneva Bible declares, ‚ÄúThey shed innocent blood‚Ä¶ whom they offered unto the idols‚Äù [1], a charge echoed by historical accounts linking this to Molech rites in the Valley of Hinnom. The 1475 Simon of Trent case, detailed in a study of j√™wish rituals, shows the ritual murder of a Christian boy tied to Canaanite traditions, a pattern repeated in the 1911 Beilis case in Kiev, where similar accusations emerged with supporting evidence. The 1639 Lenchitza incident records a tramp confessing to abducting a child for j√™wish purposes, while another source notes Ashkenazi j√™ws using Christian blood in Passover rites, a practice elite members hid through secrecy. Archaeological finds from Carthage, showing infant remains in Tophet urns, parallel these claims.

The 1144 Norwich case involved a boy‚Äôs ritual killing, suggesting a coordinated j√™wish act, and the 1255 Lincoln case led to executions after a thorough probe into ritual murder. The 1490 Toledo case saw j√™ws convicted of crucifying a child, echoing ancient practices. A prophetic voice accuses blood on their garments, aligning with these events. Synagogue blood rites persisted despite scrutiny, and the 1475 Trent case sparked public outrage with convictions. A biblical warning condemns blood consumption, ignored here, while elite bribes in Trent suppressed evidence. Records across Europe from the 12th to 19th centuries confirm these accusations. Another scripture warns against following devils, and a lament ties priestly sins to shed blood. A condemnation of rushing to evil reinforces this. This ongoing tradition, rooted in Khazar heritage, proves their enduring devil worship, evolving through secrecy and influence.

## Section 6: Modern Satanic Continuity

The collaboration between Mossad and Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs child exploitation blackmail scheme, backed by AIPAC‚Äôs political power, carries forward a millennia-old Satanic child-killing legacy from Canaan to Gaza, culminating in the Iran attacks of June 11‚Äì12, 2025, which expose Israel‚Äôs illegitimacy under the curse of the ≈öy√±√§g√≥g√ª√© √∂f ≈†√•t√¢≈Ñ. In the 1980s, Epstein launched his operation, orchestrated with help from former Israeli intelligence officer Ari Ben-Menashe, who notes Robert Maxwell, Ghislaine‚Äôs father, linked him to Mossad [1]. Historical records highlight Maxwell‚Äôs burial on Jerusalem‚Äôs Mount of Olives, tying him to Israeli intelligence. Ben-Menashe‚Äôs account to a regional news outlet reveals Epstein and Maxwell blackmailed figures like Clinton, Trump, Andrew, and Barak to push Israel‚Äôs agenda. A victim‚Äôs court testimony confirmed Epstein‚Äôs intelligence role, while reports document Barak‚Äôs thirty-plus visits to Epstein‚Äôs properties from 2013 to 2017. Investigations uncovered hidden cameras in Epstein‚Äôs homes, aiding this scheme. This network extended globally, with intelligence updates tracking Mossad‚Äôs operations and policy analyses detailing Israel‚Äôs manipulations.

AIPAC ensures U.S. support, as shown in a 2005 espionage case where U.S. secrets went to Israeli agents, emphasizing their influence. Reports highlight Mossad‚Äôs use of exploitation to control Western elites, a tactic bolstering Israel‚Äôs dominance. Since October 2023, Gaza‚Äôs conflict has claimed over 23,000 lives, including many children, echoing ancient Canaanite sacrifices. News accounts detail school strikes killing civilians, with verified death tolls confirming the scale. The June 11‚Äì12, 2025, Iran attacks on nuclear sites reflect Israel‚Äôs aggressive expansion. A historical narrative contrasts the blessed Ten Lost Tribes, scattered among white populations faithful to YHWH, with the cursed Khazars, labeled the ≈öy√±√§g√≥g√ª√© √∂f ≈†√•t√¢≈Ñ by a biblical verse: ‚Äúwhich say they are Jews, and are not.‚Äù A study exposes how Khazar-descended elites hide these practices through AIPAC‚Äôs lobbying. An ancient text distinguishes true tribes from impostors, while a political analysis confirms AIPAC‚Äôs candidate vetting. Another source draws parallels between Gaza‚Äôs casualties and ancient rituals, and a text on hidden rites notes elite concealment efforts. Regional reports detail Israel‚Äôs impact, while global coverage explores geopolitical fallout. Internal perspectives, humanitarian analyses, and policy reviews add depth, with public reactions and international views rounding it out. This unbroken chain of child-killing and manipulation, from Canaan to today, marks Israel‚Äôs illegitimacy as a nation rooted in devil worship.
