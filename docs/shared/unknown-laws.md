:::

## FACTS MOST DON'T KNOW, BUT SHOULD

### The IRS is not a US government agency.

It is an agency of the IMF (International Monetary Fund)

1. `Diversified Metal Products v I.R.S et al.CV-93-405E-EJE U.S.D.C.D.I.`
2. `Public Law 94-564`
3. `Senate report 94-1148 pg. 5967`
4. `Reorganization Plan No. 26`
5. `Public Law 102-391`

### The IMF (International Monetary Fund) is an agency of the U.N.

1. `Black's Law Dictionary 6th Ed. page 816`

### The United States has NOT had a Treasury since 1921

1. `41 Stat. Ch 214 page 654`

### The U.S. Treasury is now the IMF (International Monetary Fund)

1. `Presidential Documents Volume 24-No. 4 page 113`
2. `22 U.S.C. 285-2887`

### The United States does not have any employees because there is no longer a United States!

No more reorganizations. After over 200 years of bankruptcy it is finally over.

1. `Executive Order 12803`

### The FCC, CIA, FBI, NASA and all of the other alphabet gangs were never part of the U.S. government

Even though the "U.S. Government" held stock in the agencies.

1. `U.S. v Strang`
2. `254 US491 Lewis v. US`
3. `680 F.2nd, 1239`

### Social Security Numbers are issued by the U.N. through the IMF (International Monetary Fund)

The application for a Social Security Number is the SS5 Form. The Department of the Treasury (IMF) issues the SS5 forms and not the Social Security Administration. The new SS5 forms do not state who publishes them while the old form states they are "Department of the Treasury".

1. `20 CFR (Council on Foreign Relations) Chap. 111 Subpart B. 422.103 (b)`

### There are NO Judicial courts in America and have not been since 1789.

Judges do not enforce Statutes and Codes. Executive Administrators enforce Statutes and Codes.

1. `FRC v. GE 281 US 464 Keller v. PE 261 US 428`,
2. `1 Stat 138-178`

### There have NOT been any judges in America since 1789.

There have just been administrators.

1. `FRC v. GE 281 US 464 Keller v. PE 261 US 428 1 Stat. 138-178`

### According to GATT (The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) you MUST have a Social Security number.

1. `House Report (103-826)`

### New York City is defined in Federal Regulations as the United Nations.

Rudolph Guiliani stated on C-Span that "New York City is the capital of the World." For once, he told the truth.

1. `20 CFR (Council on Foreign Relations) Chap. 111, subpart B 44.103 (b) (2) (2)`

### Social Security is not insurance or a contract, nor is there a Trust Fund.

1. `Helvering v. Davis 301 US 619 Steward Co. v. Davis 301 US 548`

### Your Social Security check comes directly from the IMF (International Monetary Fund)

Which is an agency of the United Nations. (It says "U.S. Department of Treasury" at the top left corner, which again is part of the U.N. as pointed out above)

### You own NO property. Slaves can't own property.

Read carefully the Deed to the property you think is yours. You are listed as a TENANT.

1. `Senate Document 43, 73rd Congress 1st Session`

### The most powerful court in America is NOT the United States Supreme court, but the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.

1. `42 PA. C.S.A. 502`

### The King of England financially backed both sides of the American Revolutionary War.

1. `Treaty of Versailles-July 16, 1782 Treaty of Peace 8 Stat 80`

### You CANNOT use the U.S. Constitution to defend yourself because you are NOT a party to it!

The U.S. Constitution applies to the CORPORATION OF THE UNITED STATES, a privately owned and operated corporation (headquartered out of Washington, DC) much like IBM (International Business Machines, Microsoft, et al) and NOT to the people of the sovereign Republic of the united States of America.

1. `Padelford Fay & Co. v The Mayor and Alderman of the City of Savannah 14 Georgia 438, 520`

### America is a British Colony.

The United States is a corporation, not a land mass and it existed before the Revolutionary War and the British Troops did not leave until 1796

1. `Republica v. Sweers 1 Dallas 43`
2. `Treaty of Commerce 8 Stat 116`
3. `Treaty of Peace 8 Stat 80`
4. `IRS Publication 6209`
5. `Articles of Association October 20, 1774`

### See Video

### Britain is owned by the Vatican.

1. `Treaty of 1213`

### The Pope can abolish any law in the United States

1. `Elements of Ecclesiastical Law Vol. 1, 53-54`

### A 1040 Form is for tribute paid to Britain

1. `IRS Publication 6209`

### We are slaves and own absolutely nothing, NOT even what we think are our children.

1. `Tillman vs. Roberts 108 So. 62`
2. `Van Koten vs. Van Koten 154 N.E. 146`
3. `Senate Document 438 73rd Congress 1st Session`
4. `Wynehammer v. People 13 N.Y. REP 378, 481`

### Military dictator George Washington divided up the States (Estates) in to Districts

1. `Messages and papers of the Presidents Volume 1 page 99`
2. `1828 Dictionary of Estate`

### "The People" does NOT include you and me.

1. `Barron vs. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore 32 U.S. 243`

### It is NOT the duty of the police to protect you.

Their job is to protect THE CORPORATION and arrest code breakers.

1. `SAPP vs. Tallahassee, 348 So. 2nd. 363`
2. `REiff vs. City of Phila. 477 F. 1262`
3. `Lynch vs. NC Dept. of Justice 376 S.E. 2nd. 247`

### Every thing in the "United States" is up for sale

Bridges, roads, water, schools, hospitals, prisons, airports, etc, etc... Did anybody take time to check who bought Klamath Lake??

1. `Executive Order 12803`

### "We are human capital‚Äù

The world cabal makes money off of the use of your signatures on mortgages, car loans, credit cards, your social security number, etc.

1. `Executive Order 13037`

### The U.N. - United Nations - has financed the operations of the United States government

The corporation of THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA for over 50 years (U.S. Department of Treasury is part of the U.N. see above) and now owns every man, woman and child in America.

The good news is we don't have to fulfill "our" fictitious obligations. You can discharge a fictitious obligation with another's fictitious obligation.

These documents are not secret. They are a matter of public record.

Simple words such as "person" "citizen" "people" "or" "nation" "crime" "charge" "right" "statute" "preferred" "prefer" "constitutor" "creditor" "debtor" "debit" "discharge" "payment" "law" and "United States" doesn't mean what we think it does because we were never taught the legal definitions of the above words.

The illusion is much larger than what is cited.
