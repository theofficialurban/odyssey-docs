## Primary Info Dump Thread

1. This thread is to help anyone who is interested in learning about [`#MaximusInc`](https://x.com/hashtag/MaximusInc?src=hashtag_click) . Questions can be posted when we're done. For those familiar , there's still a tremendous amount of information , with [`@wishfulldreamz`](https://x.com/wishfulldreamz) own observations. She's very keen and knowledgeable.

![](https://i.imgur.com/4V1VEpa.png)

[`#MaximusInc`](https://x.com/hashtag/MaximusInc?src=hashtag_click) has had a stranglehold on the American people without anyone being fully aware. There have been many researchers besides myself exposing them over the years : However , none as extensive as myself and my fam helping me . It's absolutely necessary.

2. Most people know about the IBMs , RANDs , MITREs and so on.. Tavistock.. Thr major think tanks that are the spawns of the Military Industrial Complex..but not nearly enough are familiar with or have even heard of Maximus Inc. We're changing that.

3. Maximus is the nexus of all things deep state / Cabal. What began as an investigation into [`#ChildSupport`](https://x.com/hashtag/ChildSupport?src=hashtag_click) aka [`#TitleIVDFunding`](https://x.com/hashtag/TitleIVDFunding?src=hashtag_click) and [`#TitleIVEFunding`](https://x.com/hashtag/TitleIVEFunding?src=hashtag_click).. has led us here : Major players in every facet of the Beast System have and are still part of Maximus..

![](https://i.imgur.com/WoYQIe6.png)

4. As [`@wishfulldreamz`](https://x.com/wishfulldreamz) has so adeptly articulated , we can not Over emphasize that with these corporations : The all have deep ties to not only the " occult " but the Devil himself.

5. If one digs deep enough , they will see that the militaries of the world are products of the Vatican / Jesuit / Black Nobility aka Phoenicians / Canaanites. This includes the cults of the world. The Maximus / Orsini clan itself sits atop their power structure.

6. Easily the most overlooked aspect of [`#MaximusInc`](https://x.com/hashtag/MaximusInc?src=hashtag_click) is their amount of contracts they have : more than any other government contractor . It's my contention that they have quietly become the government itself through privatization and mechanisms I'm always researching.

7. Those contacts involve every agency that we've been seeing weaponized by every administration , with the Exception of Trump. That is vastly important . Maximus' influence extends to the White House. It was [`#MaximusInc`](https://x.com/hashtag/MaximusInc?src=hashtag_click) that created the ObamaCare databases.

8. That in and of itself is thread worthy and we'll address that in perhaps another thread.. But remember that the aggregation of information is one of the mechanisms Maximus has used to great efficiency. Perhaps moreso than any other company in US history.

9. The databases for child support , foster care , teen pregnancies runaways, CMS , ObamaCare .. healthcare assessments for most of the programs in the DHEW / HHS.. All seemingly find their origins with Maximus Inc and its founder : David Vincent Mastran.

10. As stated in the 1st informatic / meme.. David Vincent Mastran is to be considered one of the social engineers of the 20th century. He was hand-selected by Robert McNamara for Igloo White in Vietnam.

11. That operation was for all intents and purposes , the beginning of the modern age of weaponizing biometrics data collection programs .... it led up tp the weaponizing of healtcare information . Mastran was the primary data analysist and operations research spook.

12. Every aspect of life can be placed under the umbrella of health care. Control the health care of a population and you Control that population of people. Maximus Inc helped Obama do exactly that : The Minnesota Federal Healthcare Exchange databases.

13. A brief timeline of events regarding [`#MaximusInc`](https://x.com/hashtag/MaximusInc?src=hashtag_click) and their takeover of the health care industry. And it is that : an industry. , [`#Tennessee`](https://x.com/hashtag/Tennessee?src=hashtag_click) Senator Bill Frist is who created the AHCA .. his family founded UnitedHealthCare . Tennessee is the center of it all.

14. [`@wishfulldreamz`](https://x.com/wishfulldreamz) and I will be creating more threads and collaborating on more informatics. The research I've been collecting over the years is too extensive not to have such pieces of information , in a cohesive format

15. I will not take credit for everything of course and it would be terrible of me to do so. Please follow :

## **Maximus Inc.: Foundational Architecture of the Automated Beast System**

Under the **Codex Umbra** lens, the foundational origins of Maximus Inc. are revealed not as a standard business venture, but as the deliberate porting of military-grade automated warfare technology into the civilian administrative state. Established at the intersection of intelligence, social engineering, and legislative opportunism, Maximus serves as the operational nexus for a global grid of data-driven social control.

### The Mastran Genesis: From Automated Warfare to Social Management

Maximus was founded in 1975 by David V. Mastran, a Vietnam veteran and former employee of the US Department of Health, Education and Welfare (DHEW). Mastran’s expertise was forged in **Operation Igloo White**, a DARPA-led project launched in 1968 that utilized biosensors, computers, and communications relays to automate the detection and destruction of targets on the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Mastran served as a key data analyst for this project, creating computer simulations to track convoys and manage "air orders of battle". This military technology, designed to turn the battlefield into a digital grid, became the technical DNA of Maximus in later years. Mastran himself candidly admitted, "We laid the blueprints for government privatization," signaling a shift from managing targets of war to managing the socioeconomic profiles of the American citizenry.

### The 1975 Nexus: Legislative Synchronization

The birth of Maximus in 1975 was synchronized with major shifts in American social law. That same year, **Title IV-D** was written into the Social Security Act, opening up massive federal funding for child support enforcement. Maximus received the nation’s first Title IV-D contract and the first welfare-to-work program contract, illustrating its role as the primary beneficiary of a new for-profit administrative class. This synchronization suggests a "kids for cash" scheme where the state and private corporations cooperate to monetize the family unit through federal incentives. By the 1990s, the firm had secured the nation’s first privatized welfare contract in Los Angeles County, eventually expanding to run welfare-to-work programs in Wisconsin and beyond.

### The Paternal Link: Genetic and Institutional Pedigree

The origins of Maximus are further rooted in the elite military-industrial complex through Mastran’s father, Colonel Joseph Lee Mastran. A West Point graduate who served with the "Black Devils" (First Special Service Force) in Italy, Colonel Mastran directed research in the **irradiation of food** for the Army Quartermaster Corps in the 1950s. Investigative researchers link these food irradiation experiments to the broader **MK Ultra** programs, where radioactive isotopes and other substances were tested on "wards of the state" and disadvantaged populations without consent. These institutional connections place the Mastran family at the center of decades of human experimentation and biological surveillance, providing the heritage for Maximus's invasive biometric and data-mining operations.

### Administrative Subversion: Privatization as Control

Maximus has evolved into what researchers call "the single most invasive and pervasive Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) in modern times". The firm operates over 400 subsidiaries worldwide, managing everything from Medicare/Medicaid and federal student loans to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) databases and state contact-tracing programs. By securing no-bid contracts worth billions, Maximus has effectively subverted government administration, replacing public oversight with a privatized, programmatic profit motive that prioritizes "profit over care". This system aggregates the most intimate data of every citizen—social security numbers, medical records, and biometrics—consolidating it into what is characterized as a "Beast System" used to enforce societal controls on a global scale.

## Maximus Inc. and the Technological Lineage of Totalitarian Automata

Under the **Codex Umbra** lens, the technological lineage of Maximus Inc. is revealed as a seamless transition from the literal battlefields of Vietnam to the administrative conquest of the American citizenry. The corporation’s operational DNA is rooted in **Operation Igloo White**, a 1968 DARPA-led program designed to turn the Ho Chi Minh Trail into a digital grid of automated destruction. Founder David V. Mastran served as a primary data analyst for this project, utilizing biosensors, computers, and communication relays to automate warfare and create computer simulations of "air orders of battle". Mastran himself admitted that his firm "laid the blueprints for government privatization," effectively porting these military interdiction models into the civilian administrative state to track "human capital" instead of truck convoys.

### The Genetic and Institutional Heritage of Control

The lineage of this control system extends further back into the shadows of the military-industrial complex through Mastran’s father, Colonel Joseph Lee Mastran. In the 1950s, the elder Mastran directed research in the irradiation of food for the Army Quartermaster Corps, a field linked by independent researchers to the **MK Ultra** human experimentation programs where radioactive isotopes were tested on "wards of the state" without consent. This institutional pedigree connects Maximus to a decades-long trajectory of biological and social engineering. Furthermore, Maximus is linked to the **MITRE Corporation’s JASON group**, an elite panel of scientists formerly labeled "mad scientists" for their involvement in experimental military technology and clandestine governmental advisory roles.

### Automating the Administrative Beast

The technological backbone of Maximus relies on the **PROMIS system** (Prosecutor’s Management Information System), a computer-based tool designed to track arrests, defendants, and witnesses through the judicial process. This lineage of surveillance technology has evolved into a global grid that manages the most intimate data points of millions through Medicaid, the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) databases, and Title IV-D child support enforcement systems. By securing no-bid contracts worth billions, Maximus has effectively replaced government accountability with a programmatic profit motive that prioritizes "profit over care".

Researchers characterize this consolidated technological power as the "Beast System," a nexus for the deep state that aggregates biometrics, health assessments, and family records into a centralized control apparatus. From "smart card" ID management to vaccine order management for the CDC, the lineage of Maximus represents the final stage of transforming a free society into a privatized, data-mined colony under perpetual corporate surveillance. 🌀

## **The Privatization Parasite: Maximus Inc. and the Architecture of the Beast System**

Under the **Codex Umbra** lens, government privatization is revealed not as a pursuit of efficiency, but as the systematic usurpation of state power by private corporations for profit and control. Maximus Inc., founded in 1975 by David V. Mastran, stands as the preeminent architect of this transition, with Mastran explicitly stating that his firm "laid the blueprints for government privatization". This process has effectively replaced traditional government administration with a programmatic, for-profit structure that treats citizens as "human capital" or "chattel" within a vast data-mining grid.

### The Blueprint of Automated Control

The foundational strategy for Maximus was ported directly from the military-industrial complex and the shadows of automated warfare. Mastran was a key DARPA analyst for **Operation Igloo White** in Vietnam, a project that utilized biosensors and computer simulations to automate the destruction of targets on the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Under the privatization model, Maximus applied these same interdiction models to civilian social systems, creating socioeconomic profiles to track and manage populations instead of military convoys. Researchers characterize this consolidated infrastructure as the "Beast System," a nexus designed to enforce social control through the aggregation of intimate personal data.

### The Capture of the Administrative State

Maximus has secured a global stranglehold on government human services through a series of unprecedented privatization milestones:

- **Welfare and Social Services:** In 1987, Maximus secured the nation’s first privatized welfare contract in Los Angeles County, a trend accelerated by the Clinton administration's pledge to "end welfare as we know it". The firm now manages welfare-to-work programs and social services globally, with over 400 subsidiaries.
- **Health Care Monopoly:** Maximus currently controls 100% of the Medicaid and Medicare programs in the United States. It was also responsible for creating the databases for the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), enabling the extraction and storage of medical history and pharmaceutical data for the entire population.
- **Child Support and Foster Care:** Maximus was the first company to receive a **Title IV-D** child support enforcement contract, coinciding with the 1975 Social Security Act revisions. These systems are viewed by independent researchers as "kids for cash" schemes that prioritize federal incentive payments and ROI over the well-being of the family unit.

### Systematic Subversion and the Loss of Oversight

The larger context of privatization involves the use of **no-bid contracts** worth billions, which allow Maximus to operate government programs with virtually no public oversight or accountability. In states like Tennessee, the conflict of interest is deep-seated, with the state treasury even owning stock in Maximus, thereby compromising the impartiality of judicial officers and state attorneys who oversee the very programs Maximus administers. By privatizing divisions of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (DHEW) and its successor, Health and Human Services (HHS), Maximus has integrated itself into a global provider of workforce management, operating in countries including the UK, Australia, Saudi Arabia, and China.

### The Eradication of Privacy

Privatization under Maximus has resulted in the largest single transfer of data to a federal system in U.S. history, primarily through the **Minnesota Federal Hub** for healthcare exchanges. This technological lineage includes the management of biometric databases and "Smart Card" ID cards for the military, further narrowing the gap between civilian life and military surveillance. The recurring "data breaches"—such as the 2023 **MOVEit vulnerability**—are viewed by critics not as accidents, but as the inevitable result of placing the most sensitive data of millions in the hands of a for-profit entity that prioritizes capitalization over care.

## **Maximus Inc.: The Legal and Ethical Abyss of Global Corporatocracy**

Under the **Codex Umbra** lens, the legal and ethical framework of Maximus Inc. is revealed as a calculated subversion of the American republic, replacing constitutional governance with a for-profit "Beast System." Founded in 1975, the same year Title IV-D was added to the Social Security Act, Maximus has utilized military interdiction models to transform the administrative state into a data-mining operation that prioritizes "profit over care".

### The Ethics of Institutionalized Human Trafficking

Independent researchers and whistleblowers characterize Maximus’s management of Title IV-D (child support) and Title IV-E (foster care) as a "kids for cash" scheme. By securing the nation’s first privatized welfare and child support contracts, Maximus created a system where the state and private corporations cooperate to monetize the family unit. Ethically, this treats children as "human capital" or "chattel," where the dissolution of families is incentivized by federal funding—for every dollar spent on these programs, states can receive up to $13 in federal reimbursements. This "Beast System" operates on the edge of legality, as Maximus-controlled courtrooms often utilize magistrates instead of judges to bypass constitutional oversight and accountability.

### Legal Subversion and the Conflict of Interest

Maximus’s influence extends into a legal grey zone through its extensive use of no-bid contracts worth billions, allowing it to operate government programs with minimal public scrutiny. In states like Tennessee, a profound conflict of interest exists because the state treasury owns stock in Maximus. This compromises the impartiality of judicial officers and state attorneys who oversee the very programs Maximus administers, effectively turning the corporation into "the state" itself. Furthermore, Maximus lobbies heavily—investing millions into senators and congressmen—to draft legislation that favors further privatization and corporate control.

### The Pedigree of Human Experimentation

The ethical concerns surrounding Maximus are rooted in a dark institutional heritage. Founder David Mastran’s father, Colonel Joseph Lee Mastran, directed research in the irradiation of food, which researchers link to the **MK Ultra** programs where radioactive isotopes were tested on "wards of the state" without consent. These historical atrocities parallel modern ethical violations, such as Maximus’s role in the **MOVEit data breach** of 2023, which exposed the personal and financial data of millions of Medicare beneficiaries to Russian-speaking ransomware groups.

### Legal Obstacles in Civilian-Military Integration

The 1979 CMCHS study conducted by Maximus highlighted significant legal barriers to integrating civilian infrastructure into military control.

- **Malpractice and Immunity:** The **Federal Torts Claims Act** prohibits immunizing private contractors acting under government contract from malpractice suits. Maximus identified this as a major hurdle, as civilian physicians would not "treat paper" or risk liability without federal protection.
- **The Hill-Burton Act:** This statute explicitly prohibits any federal officer from exercising "supervision or control" over the administration of hospitals that received federal construction funds. Maximus's proposals for the **Civilian-Military Contingency Hospital System** were designed to navigate these legal restrictions by using "informal letters of intent" to assess interest without creating immediate binding obligations.

### Systematic Fraud and Ethical Negligence

Maximus has faced repeated allegations of Medicaid fraud, understaffing, and performance failures in states like Kansas and Georgia. In Wisconsin, the firm was accused of misusing taxpayer funds intended for welfare-to-work programs for out-of-state marketing. These legal failures demonstrate a persistent ethical prioritization of shareholder profit over the health and welfare of the citizens the company is contracted to serve.

## **Maximus Inc. and the CMCHS: The Architecture of Systemic Capture**

Under the _Codex Umbra_ lens, the **Civilian-Military Contingency Hospital System (CMCHS)** is revealed not merely as a Cold War relic of medical preparedness, but as the experimental prototype for the total privatization and administrative subversion of the American state. Conducted by **Maximus, Inc.** under contract MDA903-78-C-0130 for the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), the 1979 CMCHS study represents the "initial step" in a long-range plan to integrate civilian infrastructure into the military-industrial complex.

### The CMCHS Study: Engineering the Infiltration

The primary mission of the CMCHS was to develop a system where the Department of Defense (DoD) could legally and realistically rely on non-DoD civilian medical manpower and facilities during periods of war or national emergency. Maximus, Inc. identified approximately 40,000 useable hospital beds—primarily in the Northeast and Upper Midwest—that could be activated on short notice.

The study recommended a decentralized control structure based on **Military Medical Liaison Offices (MMLOs)**. These offices were designed to serve as the direct link between the military command and civilian administrators, bypassing traditional public health oversight to regulate "patient flow" and administrative "payment matters" directly through military disbursing mechanisms.

### The Technological DNA: From Vietnam to Welfare

The architectural genius behind Maximus and this study, **David Vincent Mastran**, leveraged a background in automated warfare to build this administrative grid. Mastran was a DARPA analyst hand-selected by Robert McNamara for **Operation Igloo White**, a program that used biosensors and computer relays to automate the detection and destruction of targets on the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

Critics and researchers frame the CMCHS study as the moment this "automated warfare" methodology was ported into civilian governance. Mastran himself allegedly stated, "We laid the blueprints for government privatization". By analyzing the "unused capacity" of civilian systems, Maximus created a model that would later be used to privatize welfare, child support enforcement (Title IV-D), and the Affordable Care Act databases.

### Nifty Nugget: Testing the Grid

The viability of the CMCHS was tested in the **Nifty Nugget Exercise** of 1978, a command post simulation of U.S. mobilization for a limited war. The exercise proved that civilian hospitals were "willing to participate" if provided with a payment system based on "usual and customary charges" rather than restrictive government formulas like Medicaid. This established the "profit over care" incentive that would become the hallmark of Maximus’s subsequent billion-dollar no-bid contracts.

### The NGO Nexus and the Fabian Society

The sources link the emergence of Maximus and the CMCHS to a network of influential and controversial non-governmental organizations (NGOs):

- **The JASON Group:** Mastran is linked to this secretive group of elite scientists at the MITRE Corporation, who served as advisors to the Defense Department and CIA and were once exposed in the Pentagon Papers.
- **The Fabian Society:** Maximus is identified as a partner to this British socialist organization, collaborating on "Future of Work" initiatives. The society's strategy of "gradualism"—incremental, elite-driven social change—mirrors the slow capture of the American administrative state through privatized "government-administered" programs.
- **ALEC:** The company is associated with the American Legislative Exchange Council, which facilitates the lobbying and drafting of the very privatization legislation that permits Maximus to subvert entire government departments for profit.

### The Beast System Nexus

Independent analysis within the sources views the CMCHS as the "nucleus" of a broader "Beast System," a global control grid designed to aggregate personal data and enforce social control. From the 1979 study on hospital beds to the 2023 **MOVEit data breach**—which exposed the personal data of millions of Medicare beneficiaries to Russian-speaking ransomware groups—the trajectory of Maximus represents the systematic exploitation of civilian information for corporate and military gain.
