::: info Who is Kevin Annett?

Through the International Common Law Court of Justice (ICLCJ), where he serves as a chief advisor, Kevin is spearheading a 2025 criminal lawsuit charging Pope Leo with murder, conspiracy, and crimes against humanity. Drawing on chilling eyewitness testimonies, Vatican archives, and INTERPOL records, Kevin's investigation reveals Pope Leo’s alleged role in ritualistic child sacrifice, trafficking, and drug trade cover-ups, implicating other global elites like Donald Trump, King Charles III, Cardinal Dolan - who’s name you’ve heard on this podcast before from Catholic School survivor Chris O’Leary, and even the CEO of Pfizer.

Born in Edmonton, Canada, in 1956, Kevin was a United Church minister turned global human rights crusader whose relentless pursuit of truth has shaken the foundations of power. Known as Eagle Strong Voice, Kevin’s life transformed when he uncovered horrific crimes at the Port Alberni Indian Residential School in the early 1990s. His refusal to stay silent cost him his ministry, marriage, and reputation, as the United Church and Canadian authorities blacklisted him. Undeterred, Kevin’s courage ignited a movement to expose systemic genocide, leading him to confront one of the world’s most powerful institutions: the Vatican.

Kevin’s groundbreaking work began with the 1998 human rights tribunal in Vancouver, where he documented Canada’s residential school genocide, forcing the nation to face its dark past. His award-winning documentary Unrepentant and books like Hidden from History: The Canadian Holocaust brought global attention to the deaths of thousands of Indigenous children, compelling Canada’s 2008 apology. But Kevin’s mission didn’t stop there. In 2010, he co-founded the International Tribunal into Crimes of Church and State (ITCCS), uniting survivors across 26 countries to hold the Vatican, British Crown, and others accountable for crimes against humanity. His efforts led to the historic resignation of Pope Benedict in 2013 after the ITCCS convicted him of complicity in child trafficking and abuse.

As discussed on our last episode, Kevin has now set his sights on exposing the shadowy Ninth Circle cult and its sinister leader, our current Pope, Pope Leo. Through the International Common Law Court of Justice (ICLCJ), where he serves as a chief advisor, Kevin is spearheading a 2025 criminal lawsuit charging Pope Leo with murder, conspiracy, and crimes against humanity. Drawing on chilling eyewitness testimonies, Vatican archives, and INTERPOL records, Kevin's investigation reveals Pope Leo’s alleged role in ritualistic child sacrifice, trafficking, and drug trade cover-ups, implicating other global elites like Donald Trump, King Charles III, Cardinal Dolan - who’s name you’ve heard on this podcast before from Catholic School survivor Chris O’Leary, and even the CEO of Pfizer. Today, he will be updating us on what’s happened since the last time he was on, where the case stands today, and what is next. This is a case you will want to closely follow if you aren’t already and a gripping episode you will want to watch all the way through!

Despite smears, blacklisting, and threats, Kevin remains unyielding - inspiring survivors and truth-seekers worldwide. Kevin’s radio program Here We Stand and the Republic of Kanata movement amplify his call for accountability and grassroots resistance.

Kevin is a beacon of hope, proving one voice can challenge empires. His fearless stand against the Vatican and Pope Leo calls us all to action, igniting a global movement for justice and healing. Join him at www.murderbydecree.com to stand with the voiceless, reclaim truth, and build a world where no child suffers in silence. Together, with fearless leaders like Kevin leading the way, we can forge a future of courage, compassion, and unstoppable change.

## International Common Law Court of Justice

### Background & Evidence

One month ago, on September 8, 2025, the Criminal Trial Division of the International Common Law Court of Justice convened its proceedings against the defendants by issuing them Summonses to Appear to answer the charges made against them by the Court’s Prosecutor. None of the summoned defendants contested or denied those charges. Accordingly, the Court Prosecutor commenced his case against them.

The Prosecution began by describing the lawful basis of the proceedings as a Tribunal of Conscience under International Law, the absence of any other judicial body willing to try the case, the command responsibility of the defendants for their heinous crimes, and their particular culpability because of their association with convicted criminal organizations and their tacit admission of **_pro confesso_** guilt by their refusal to plea.

Over the next three weeks, the Prosecution presented to the Court detailed evidence proving the guilt of the defendants, including with live eyewitness testimonies, legal affidavits, coroners’ reports, forensic artifacts, extensive documentation, video and photographic evidence, and church, government, and corporate records and correspondence.

During the first week of the trial proceedings, the Court received back channel communications from two of the defendants requesting amnesty from prosecution in exchange for their testimonies. The defendants in question were Keith Schiller, former bodyguard to Donald Trump, and Gary Paterson, former Moderator of the United Church of Canada.

According to the Prosecution, both Schiller and Paterson, like all the defendants, are confirmed participants in Ninth Circle cult ceremonies and their related ‘snuff films’ and thereby directly implicated in the ritual rape, murder and cannibalizing of children. The Court therefore denied Schiller’s and Paterson’s request for amnesty and ordered them to enter a plea. Like the other defendants, neither Schiller nor Paterson did so, affirming their pro confesso guilt under law. However, both Schiller and Paterson were enjoined to divulge their knowledge of the charges against them and the other defendants, which they did without recourse to legal counsel.

During the trial’s third week, the Court received remarkable new evidence from sources within the Church of Rome in America. This evidence revealed the involvement of Donald Trump, ‘Pope’ Robert Prevost and Cardinal Timothy Dolan and his church associates\* in the murders of Charlie Kirk, Mormon church leader Russell Nelson, Virginia Giuffre, Deutsche Bank officers Valentin Broeksmit and Thomas Bowers, and Rev. Joe Moreno of Buffalo, New York. This evidence sheds more light on the extent of the Ninth Circle cult’s operations in America and their close association with the Mormon and Vatican assassination agencies known respectively as the Danites and Santa Alleanza.

***(*Note: The other Catholic clergy in America who are complicit in the murder of Rev. Joe Moreno include Bishops Richard Malone and Edward Grosz, Vicar David LiPuma, Deacon Paul Weisenburger, priests Joseph Gatto and Arthur Smith, and church enforcer Francis Mazur. As secondary co-conspirators they will be prosecuted in an upcoming case of the Court.)\***

During this same week, the Prosecution received confirmation of an extensive child trafficking and killing network spanning the Canadian-American border across Lake Erie. A child trafficking pipeline that services Ninth Circle covens in southern Canada runs from Cleveland and Buffalo to Brantford, London, Hamilton and Toronto, Ontario. Six of the defendants are directly implicated in this network: ‘King’ Charles Windsor, Andrew Windsor, Catholic Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Anglican Archbishops Justin Welby and Fred Hiltz, and former United Church Moderator Gary Paterson.

Evidence concerning the guilt of the defendants NATO chief Mark Rutte, Vatican Cardinals Pietro Parolin and Reinhard Marx, and Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla was provided to the Prosecutor by INTERPOL, Ninth Circle and corporate sources in New York and Europe. At the behest of the Chinese government with whom he is intimately connected, Parolin attempted to manipulate Mark Rutte as head of NATO using photographic evidence from Ninth Circle rituals in which Rutte participated. A similar blackmailing was employed successfully against another Ninth Circle participant, Albert Bourla, by Parolin and Marx in their capacity as the coven’s conveners, in order to facilitate the takeover of Pfizer by the Vatican Bank (IOR).

Regardless of Rutte’s response to this latest Vatican manipulation, the effect has been to destabilize NATO on the eve of a possible confrontation with Russia, which is likely China’s plan. But it has also made new schisms within the Ninth Circle and encouraged more insiders to come forward.

In terms of these bigger geopolitical forces, it is clear from the evidence that the recent murder of Charlie Kirk in Utah and the Mormon leader Russell Nelson by Santa Alleanza and Danite agents is connected to the effort by the Vatican Bank (IOR) to channel the vast financial assets of the Mormon church towards China and the BRIC Alliance, with whom the IOR is partnered.

As part of the Mormon old guard, Nelson resisted this move and tried to prevent the amalgamation of IOR assets with those of his church. Charlie Kirk was privy to this conflict and sympathetic to Nelson’s position. But as one who was also aware of Donald Trump’s role in the murder of Giuffre, Broeksmit and the others forenamed, Kirk was a double liability for both Trump and the Vatican: particularly for ‘Pope Leo’, Robert Prevost, who along with Pietro Parolin has worked for years to strengthen ties between the IOR and Chinese investments globally.

The Prosecution submitted to the Court a huge archive of evidence pertaining to Ninth Circle ceremonies, including eyewitness accounts, coroners’ reports, videos, and 983 pages of documents. This material includes hitherto undisclosed evidence from Vatican Library archives that recount all the Ninth Circle rituals and their participants held in Rome since December 1869.

This evidence chronicles other cults associated with the Ninth Circle in Europe, North America, Australia, and Asia. A Catholic necrophilia cult was discovered by Georgina Cameron, one of our ITCCS field operatives, in Wollongong, Australia during the summer of 2022. This discovery cost Ms. Cameron her life, but not before she documented how Bishop Brian Mascord of Lumen Christi Catholic Church presides over this cult’s ritual rape and evisceration of children. He is assisted in these crimes by Prof. Iain Benson of Notre Dame University in Sydney and Catholic participants from Melbourne, Shanghai, Seattle, and Vancouver, Canada. This evidence will be included in future sessions of the Court. (http://murderbydecree.com/2024/12/25/the-bravest-of-the-brave-in-memory-of-georgina-cameron/ )

In the course of this trial, the Court has established the strong ties between the Ninth Circle and the military/corporate agencies responsible for developing microchip bio-weaponry. Three separate eyewitnesses who survived the Circle’s rituals describe the routine presence of medical researchers at the ceremonies, the warehousing of children for drug testing, microchip implantation, and blood extraction, and military-run pain threshold experiments performed on children as part of their ritual torture and sacrifice.

Pfizer Pharmaceuticals and its CEO Albert Bourla are especially implicated in these atrocities, as are other drug companies tied to Vatican money like GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, Bayer, Moderna and Eli Lilly. The mind control methods and technologies now being deployed against the general population were developed, tested, and refined within the Ninth Circle networks, at the cost of untold numbers of children’s lives.

**Note:** The personal guilt of the defendants for their involvement in Ninth Circle atrocities has been established by the Prosecution without being contested or denied by the defendants or by any contrary evidence or information. The details of the defendants’ guilt are elaborated in the judgement and sentence against them, based on the exhaustive evidence held in the files and archives of the Court. This evidence held in trust by the Court and will be made public in increments so as not to jeopardize future litigation and the identity of witnesses. Applications to review this evidence can be made to and will be considered by the Court.
