### False Identification with Israel:

The common misconception that “the jêws are Israel, or all that remains of them,” distorts the Bible’s meaning, making its history and prophecies appear false when applied to jêws, as they do not match jewish experiences but align with the Anglo-Saxon-Scandinavian and Germanic nations.

### Not True Semites:

Derived from Shem, the term “Semitic” applies to descendants of Shem; jêws, with Canaanite and Khazar ancestry, are not Semitic, while true Israelites (the Western White Christian nations) are the genuine Semites.

### Biblical Distinction Between Kingdoms:

The Bible clearly separates the northern Kingdom of Israel (10 tribes) from the southern Kingdom of Judah (Judah, Benjamin, and some Levites); jêws stem from Judah, not the entirety of Israel, with the kingdoms having distinct histories, alliances, wars, and prophetic destinies (e.g., 2 Samuel 19:40-43; 1 Kings 14-16; Isaiah 7:1-9; Jeremiah 3:6-18; Ezekiel 37:16-22).

### Different Captivities and Fates:

Israel was deported by Assyria (740-721 BC) to regions around the Caspian Sea (2 Kings 17), becoming the “Lost Ten Tribes” and migrating northward without returning; Judah faced Babylonian captivity (606-585 BC), with a remnant returning (2 Chronicles 36:20-23; Ezra 1-2), forming the jewish nation destroyed in AD 70 by Romans, fulfilling separate prophecies.

### Limited Tribal Representation:

Post-Babylon returnees were only from Judah, Benjamin, and Levi (Ezra 1-2), excluding the 10 tribes of Israel; Josephus notes Israel as a separate “immense multitude” beyond the Euphrates (Antiquities, Book 11, Chapter 5), confirming jêws do not represent all Israel.

### Unfulfilled Unconditional Promises:

God’s absolute promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob of becoming a great nation, a company of nations, numerous as stars/sand/dust, blessed eternally, and possessing enemies’ gates (Genesis 12:2; 13:16; 15:5; 17:3-7,19; 22:16-18; 26:3-5; 28; 35:11) remain unfulfilled in jêws, who are few and nationless, but are realized in the numerous, powerful Anglo-Saxon nations.

### Not a Perpetual Nation or Monarchy:

Israel promised to endure as a nation forever with an everlasting throne (Jeremiah 31:35-37; 33:17; Psalm 89:3-4; Isaiah 9:7; Luke 1:32-33), tied to celestial bodies’ existence; jêws lost nationhood in AD 70, have no king (John 19:15), and their destruction fulfills curses, not blessings.

### Name as a Curse:

Prophecy foretells jêws leaving their name as a curse to God’s chosen, with God slaying them and calling His servants (Israel) by another name (Isaiah 65:13-15); jêws’ name remains a “reproach, proverb, taunt, and curse” (Jeremiah 24:9), while Israelites (Anglo-Saxons) have new identities.

### Facial Witness Against Them:

jêws are identifiable by countenance that witnesses against them, openly declaring sin (Isaiah 3:9); Israelites lack such marking, blending into their new identities.

### Prophesied National Destruction:

jêws likened to a hardened potter’s vessel broken irreparably (Jeremiah 19), scattered to all kingdoms for harm (Jeremiah 15:4; 24:9), reduced by thirds through pestilence, sword, and dispersion (Ezekiel 5:11-12); fulfilled in AD 70, leaving them perpetual outcasts without restoration as a nation.

### Not Numerically Vast:

Israel to be uncountable like sand/stars (Hosea 1:10; Genesis refs.); jêws, estimated at 16 million (unchanged pre- and post-WWII claims), remain a diminished remnant, contradicting promises of immense multiplication.

### No Blindness to Identity:

Israel prophesied to be blind to its heritage (Romans 11:25; Isaiah 42:19-20); jêws are acutely aware of their origins, falsely claiming Israelite identity to deceive others.

### Rejection of the New Covenant:

Israel to receive God’s laws inwardly in the New Covenant (Jeremiah 31:33; Hebrews 8:10); jêws deny Christ, lacking the Father (1 John 2:23; John 15:23), and have not embraced Christianity as prophesied for Israel.

### Destined for Transgression:

As the “70 weeks” nation (Daniel 9:24), jêws fulfill prophecies of finishing transgression through idolatry and evil (e.g., under Manasseh, Jeremiah 15:4), leading to curses and scattering, not Israel’s blessings.

### Racial Impurity:

jêws intermixed with Canaanites, Edomites, Babylonians, and Khazars (converts, per sources like John Beaty), diluting any Israelite lineage; true Israel maintains purity through God’s promises, aligning with Anglo-Saxon descent from unmixed tribes.

### Not God’s Designated Servants:

God identifies Israel as His servant, chosen and not cast away (Isaiah 41:8-10; 43:1,10; 44:1-2,21-22); jêws defiled the sanctuary, facing diminishment without mercy (Ezekiel 5:11), and are not the prophesied servants.

### Adversarial Historical Role:

Unlike Israel as God’s “battle-axe” destroying kingdoms (Jeremiah 51:20; e.g., Scythians weakening Assyria/Babylon), jêws’ actions invite curses; their history of being broken and scattered matches Judah’s prophecies (Jeremiah 19; Ezekiel 5:11-12), not Israel’s victorious destiny.

### Prophetic and Historical Separation:

Numerous prophecies distinguish Israel’s blessings and regathering from Judah/jêws’ curses (Isaiah 11:12-13; Jeremiah 3:6-18; 5:11; Ezekiel 37:16-22; Hosea 1:11); jêws’ post-AD 70 wanderings fulfill destruction, while Israel migrates as Scythians/Goths/Anglo-Saxons.

### Failure to Form a Company of Nations:

Israel to become a nation and multitude of nations (Genesis 35:11); jêws never did, dissolving as a nation in AD 70 per prophecies (Jeremiah 19), unlike Anglo-Saxon formations (USA, British Commonwealth, etc.).

### No Control of Enemies’ Gates:

Israel promised dominion over strategic points (Genesis 22:17); jêws lack this, historically subjugated, while Anglo-Saxons held global gates.

### Christ’s Recognition of Separate Israel:

Jesus distinguished dispersed Israel (Matthew 10:5-6; 15:24; John 7:35; 11:49-52) from jêws, rejecting them as non-sheep (John 10:26-27); prophecies of Israel’s “lost sheep” target the tribes, not Judea’s mixed jêws.

### Deceptive Claim to Identity:

jêws falsely assert Israelite status to obscure truth, but their lack of migrations (e.g., to Scythia, then Europe as Goths/Saxons) and distinct history prove otherwise.

### Khazar Admixture:

Modern jêws predominantly descend from non-Semitic Khazar converts, further invalidating claims to chosen Israelite heritage.

### Canaanite Roots in Prophecy:

Jerusalem’s inhabitants called Canaanite due to mixing (Ezekiel 16:3); jêws embody this impure, cursed lineage, contrasting pure Israelite promises.

### Cursed Name in Prophecy:

jêws’ name cursed, while Israel renamed (Isaiah 65:15); “jêw” persists as a byword of reproach.

### Non-Fulfillment of Israel’s Prophetic Role:

Israel’s destiny as numerous nations fulfilling Genesis 35:11 (e.g., Anglo-Saxons as “company of nations”) contrasts jêws’ prophesied end (Jeremiah 19; AD 70 cessation).

### Anti-Christian Nature:

The term “anti-Semitic” was invented by modern Pharisees (jêws) who are anti-Christian, to smear and discredit Christians defending their faith from jewish onslaughts aimed at destroying Christianity; this positions jêws as adversaries to God’s chosen Israel, who embrace Christianity, highlighting jêws’ opposition to the New Covenant and Christ’s teachings, as their rejection of Jesus (and thus the Father) underscores their separation from the true heirs of God’s promises, who are the Christian Anglo-Saxon nations fulfilling biblical prophecies of blessing, expansion, and divine favor, thereby exposing the jewish claim to chosen status as a deliberate inversion intended to confuse and deceive the world about the true identity of Israel, inverting black and white as in Communist tactics, and ultimately serving to undermine the Christian faith and the divine plan for the real descendants of Israel.
