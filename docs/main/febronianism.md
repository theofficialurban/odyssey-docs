## Definition(s)

- A philosophy developed by Bishop Nikolaus von Hontheim ("Justinius Febronius") and presented in his book _On the State of the Church and the Legitimate Power of the Roman Pontiff_.
- It advocates decentralizing the Roman Catholic Church into independent national churches (States) ruled by kings, with the Pope having no legal jurisdiction but serving as a principle of unity.
- Febronianism requires "thorough popular education" where laymen, bishops, and councils are "properly enlightened" to resist papal monarchical control.
- The author asserts that this enlightenment involves indoctrination with the Jesuit _ratio studiorum_'s humanist diet, obscuring Scripture. Once the public's understanding is shaped by the Jesuit General, they will obey his will, leading to an autocratic state ruled by an invisible monarch within the Church.
- Febronianism is seen as the secret formula for returning the non-Catholic world to the Church, with the Vatican dramatically condemning the book as a "blown cover as cover" tactic.
- The author calls _On the State of the Church_ Ricci's "American Manifesto," the blueprint for realizing Bellarminian liberation in a Protestant monarchy, resulting in a "properly-ordered reunification with dissidents in the Christian religion," where Protestantism is reabsorbed into Rome, equating to its practical extirpation.

## **Freemasonry:**

- Identified as an association whose leading members attacked the Society of Jesus alongside _philosophes_ and government officials.
- Presented as a methodically practiced religion of Deism, where individuals ascend towards oneness with God through successive illumination. Deists like Freemasons looked upon the Bible as a stumbling block, preferring reason and instinct.
- The author suggests Freemasonry is a continuation of the Templar network.
- Despite papal condemnations (_Eminenti_ by Clement XII and Benedict XIV), Roman Catholic monarchs were not penalized for favoring Masonic advisors, suggesting papal absolution for actions valuable to the papacy, such as weakening the Jesuits.
- Freemasonry is described as being suffused with Jesuitic technique, being humanist religious orders, secretive, fraternal, socially conscientious, politically active, holding tradition/reason/experience over the Bible, using visualization for divine knowledge, condoning the end justifies the means, and requiring absolute obedience to a hierarchy culminating in the Jesuit General.
- The author speculates that the "G" in the Masonic emblem represents "Gesu," the Jesuits' headquarters in Rome, a secret known only to the "unknown superior".
- Freemasonry is seen as the way for the Roman Catholic Church to control Protestantism, divine right kings, and international mercantilism, recycling the old Templar infrastructure into a spiritual and economic brotherhood under the Church's eye.

## **The Two Ministries and the Mark of Cain:**

- The Bible is presented as defining two ministries: the "glorious gospel" (Jesus Christ's teachings of love, forgiveness, repentance) and the "ministration of condemnation" or "rule of law" (regulating evildoers).
- The rule of law is the system by which authorities bearing Cain's "powers and insignia of kingship" rule the World, designed for sinners rather than saints.
- Cain, the firstborn son of Eve, after killing his brother Abel, was marked by God and given protection, making him seven times more powerful than any mortal competitor. This mark is interpreted as a covenant or oath between God and Cain, representing the "powers and insignia of kingship".
- Cain's mark allowed him to rule evil, and the system requires provoking assailants to display vengeance and increase Cain's power. This is presented as essential to the self-interest of mark-bearing rulers.
- Freemasonry is described as the "custodian and depository" of the symbols, emblems, and allegories erected by Enoch (son of Cain, according to the author's interpretation), linking the institution to Cain's authority.
- The Roman Catholic Church-State organism is shown to conform readily to the rule of law, managing sin, competition, enforcing debts, and preaching an impersonal God.
- The author argues that rule by the "Trickster" (Satan, who directs the ministry of condemnation) is legitimate and divinely ordained. The Bible is presented as the only truthful disclosure of Satan's origin, scope, and purpose, and its potential to damage his appeal is why rulers discourage Bible reading.
- The "rod of iron" with which Christ rules nations and dashes them to pieces is identified with Rome (and later its heirs), the Caesarean authority to which early Christians were abandoned if they sinned against the church.
- Protestants who believe armed rulership is a Christian duty are seen as adhering to the moral guidance of the mark-bearer (Cain/Satan) because Scripture does not authorize physical armament for members of the Body of Christ.
- The ability to live safely under the Trickster's rule is found in the Bible, specifically in Habakkuk 2:4, suggesting safety in the faith that God will not abandon the righteous, even if rulers have wrong desires. The author finds that increased restriction leads one closer to God.

## _Jesuit Education_

Based on the provided sources, here are some core ideas of Jesuitism and characteristics of Jesuit education:

### **Core Ideas and Principles of Jesuitism**

- **Identity and Mission:** Jesuits are members of the Society of Jesus, founded by Ignatius Loyola. They work exclusively for the Pope and take an oath to him alone. They are sometimes referred to as the Pope's private militia or a swordless army. The purpose of the Society of Jesus, as ordained by Pope Paul III's bull _Regimini militantis ecclesiae_, is to secure the salvation of the world through the arts of war. Their core mission is to expend all their energy for the growth and continuous sanctification of the Church, making the Church present and operative in places where only they can do so. This involves endeavoring to bring every human creature into subjection to the Roman Pontiff. They aim to use their competence in secular disciplines and their activity to contribute to the equitable distribution of worldly goods and universal progress in human and Christian freedom, and to remedy customs and conditions that are an inducement to sin, conforming them to justice and virtue.
- **Identification and Strategy:** The Society is identified with signs, mottoes, and monuments. They employ a technique called "missionary adaptation," which is the adjustment of the mission subject to the cultural requirements of the mission object, aligning with existing thought patterns, evaluations, and actions to avoid unnecessary disorganization. This adaptation allows them to seamlessly integrate into secular systems, such as American secularism, to the point that the United States does not appear to be a Catholic system, despite evidence suggesting otherwise. The Society is described as a "minimal society" that is dispersed throughout the world to infiltrate various pursuits like doctors, lawyers, authors, financiers, statesmen, courtiers, diplomats, explorers, tradesmen, merchants, poets, scholars, scientists, architects, engineers, artists, printers, and philosophers, according to the papacy's needs. They also receive lay agents, called "coadjutors," who can be of any religious denomination, race, nationality, or sex and are bound by oath to serve the Superior General.
- **Obedience and Hierarchy:** A fundamental principle is absolute obedience. They take vows of poverty, chastity, obedience to the Church, and a vow of special obedience to the Pope. Their required obedience goes beyond merely obeying the will of a superior; it is an "obedience of the understanding," meaning one alters their perception of reality according to the superior's dictates. The principle is explicitly stated: "What seems to me white, I will believe black if the hierarchical Church so defines". This quality of submission means one would not even believe in the Gospels if the Holy Church were to forbid it. The head of the Society is the Superior General, sometimes called "Papa Nero" (the Black Pope). The _Constitutions_ of the Society state that the Superior General is to be "obeyed and reverenced at all times as the one who holds the place of Christ our Lord". This means the Superior General shares the divine title of "Vicar of Christ" with the Pope, but at a level unperceived by the general public. The exact size of the Society is known only to the Superior General.
- **Methods and Moral Theology:** Jesuits are noted for cunning in propagating their principles. They are described in dictionaries as given to intrigue or equivocation, crafty, designing, deceitful, and prevaricating. Practices ascribed to them include mental reservation, casuistry, and equivocation.
  - **Intrigue/Equivocation:** "To intrigue" means to cheat, trick, plot, and scheme. "To equivocate" means to use equivocal language, especially with intent to deceive, or to avoid committing oneself. Equivocal language is subject to two or more interpretations and is usually used to mislead or confuse.
  - **Mental Reservation:** This is the intentional withholding of truth when it is regarded as inconvenient to disclose it. An example given is denying forcing a window to enter premises while mentally reserving that one entered through a skylight.
  - **Casuistry:** This involves resolving specific cases of conscience, duty, or conduct through generally false interpretation of ethical principles or religious doctrine. It can be a specious argument or rationalization. Jesuit casuistry is defended as a way to retain people within the Church by making moral guidelines gentle, even if they do not violate the truth. Examples include justifying eating roast duck on Friday by mentally reserving that ducks live in water, or allowing a criminal to deny a charge with mental reservation. Casuistry even extended to justifying adultery with equivocation and giving short weight in commerce if the official price was too low.
  - **The End Justifies the Means:** A key maxim of Jesuit moral theology is _Cum finis est licitus, etiam media sunt licita_ ("If the end is legal, the means are legal"). Purity of intention can justify actions contrary to the moral code and human laws. This is presented as the essential doctrine of terrorism.
- **Militia and War:** Paul III's bull _Regimini militantis ecclesiae_ is considered a declaration of war. In war, the law sleeps, and intrigue, deceit, equivocation, casuistry, and mental reservation become the weapons of an unarmed priest. Their war is against the Bible. Their mission is to extirpate ("destroy completely, wipe out") "heretical Protestants or Liberals'" doctrines and destroy their powers. They are willing to use extreme violence to achieve this goal. However, their warfare is often of the highest sophistication, subtly conceived and masterfully executed, making their presence in the equation indiscernible to the combatants.

### **Jesuit Education (Ratio Studiorum)**

- **Goal:** The educational process, known as the _ratio studiorum_ ("method of study"), aims to obscure the moral supremacy of the Holy Bible and secure tacit obedience to the will of the black papacy. It promotes "learning against learning," pitting humanist doctrine against scriptural Christian teaching. The goal is to indoctrinate minds with illuminated humanism as opposed to the learning of Scripture.
- **Curriculum:** Jesuit schools and colleges offer an extensive system of education. The curriculum includes humane letters of different languages, logic, natural and moral philosophy, metaphysics, scholastic and positive theology. Scripture brings up the rear in this list. The rigorousness of study for any subject depends on circumstances of times, places, persons, and other factors. Scripture may be studied concurrently or later, and commentary/critical interpretation from Protestant scholars is to be ignored.
- **Selection:** While no tuition is charged, prospective students are thoroughly examined to see if they have aptitudes the Society can use.
- **Impact:** Teaching became a principal Jesuit occupation. The _ratio studiorum_ was adopted to a great extent as the basis of curricula in European colleges generally. Many of the Founding Fathers of the American Republic were educated in colleges following this curriculum. The education produces a proud, poised, imaginative graduate, enlightened by humanist learning, facile in worldly matters, moved by theatricality, and indifferent toward Holy Scripture. Producing such graduates has become the aim of modern public education. Modern media is described as state-of-the-art Jesuit _ratio studiorum_.
- **Embedded Techniques:** Elements of entertainment and dramatic production (composition, rhetoric, eloquence) are embedded in the curriculum. These link with the Spiritual Exercises to intensify the experientiality of Catholic doctrine over Scripture and Protestantism. This led to "Jesuit theatre," which was very popular and effective in winning converts or making friends among heretics. It served to capture attention that might otherwise be directed toward the Bible, thus subtly marginalizing Scripture.
- **Teaching of Methods:** Jesuit education includes teaching the "royal science" of cabalah. As noted above, they teach and elevate the practices of mental reservation, casuistry, and equivocation.

In summary, Jesuitism, as presented in these sources, is a highly disciplined, secretive, and adaptable order dedicated to the advancement of the Roman Pontiff's authority, employing cunning, flexible moral theology, and strategic infiltration. Their education system, the _ratio studiorum_, is a key tool in this mission, prioritizing humanist learning and obedience of the understanding over direct, uninterpreted engagement with Scripture, shaping minds to be receptive to papal influence while subtly marginalizing opposing doctrines.

## _Bacchic Mythology_

Based on the provided sources, the Bacchic mythology is presented as an ancient pagan narrative that provides a framework for understanding symbols found in U.S. national iconography, such as the "Apotheosis of Washington" fresco and the Great Seal. According to the author, citing Manly Hall, the motto "E PLURIBUS UNUM" directly relates to these ancient Bacchic Rites.

The core story of the Bacchic Rites, described as mysterious and fantastic, unfolds before the creation of mankind. It involves twelve Titans and Jupiter's beautiful son, Bacchus. Bacchus becomes captivated by his own reflection in a mirror. The Titans seize him, kill him, tear him to pieces, boil the pieces in water, and then roast and eat them. Bacchus's name is said to derive from _bakhah_, meaning "to weep" or "lament," referencing the grief caused by his fate.

The scattered body parts of Bacchus become the four elements of matter. One of Bacchus's sisters, the virgin Minerva, rescues his sacred heart from these elements and places it before Jupiter in Heaven. In response, Jupiter hurls thunderbolts at the Titans, reducing them to ashes. The ashes then mix with the four elements due to rain, forming "slime". From this "evil slime," Jupiter forms mankind, which is described as a "Titanic embodiment" from which the "Bacchic idea," or rational soul, must be released.

The release of the rational soul from this "evil slime" is said to be facilitated by the slime's sexual energy, especially when enhanced by alcoholic drink. This is why Bacchus is associated with grapevines, wild dancing, phallic symbols, and fornication. Following release through death and sex, a transfigured, eternal Bacchus is resurrected as the flaming Sun. This transformation from "many" (the scattered parts/mankind from the slime) into "one" (the resurrected Sun-God) is symbolized by the phrase "E PLURIBUS UNUM," meaning "One from Many".

The pentagram, a five-pointed star, also symbolizes this resurrection, representing the one (Bacchus/rational soul) rising out of the four (elements/slime) to become five. Manly Hall interprets the pentagram as "the magical formula of man," signifying the human soul rising from its animal nature. He calls it the "true light" and the "Star of the Morning," associated with the awakening of "five mysterious centers of force" that constitutes the "supreme secret of white magic".

The Bacchic Gospel, based on this mythology, is presented as a gospel of salvation that predates the Gospel of Jesus Christ by many centuries. It was preached and enacted within pagan cults, where a Holy Virgin (Minerva) would ritually rescue the Son of God's Sacred Heart from the "slime of humanity". Cult initiates sought increasing knowledge through mind-altering substances and sexual ecstasy, often administered by temple priests and priestesses for money. The goal was to be released from human form through growing knowledge and ultimately reunited with the Sacred Heart in Heaven, resurrected and transfigured for eternity.

This salvation plan, or variations of it, is described as being at the core of secret or mystery religions and "cults of empire," persisting from the earliest Babylonian prototypes down to the Great Seal. Its appeal, according to the source, lies in its approach to sin: instead of requiring repentance, it makes sin an "asset in a process of self-deification". This serves an "economy of sin management" where forgiveness is granted upon payment or performance of acts valuable to society, making it a system focused on people control. It is seen as being "congenial" to secular government and Roman Catholicism.

The source directly links the Bacchic Gospel to U.S. iconography, stating that Jupiter's eagle on the Great Seal, holding the banner inscribed "E PLURIBUS UNUM," "preaches the Bacchic Gospel". This suggests, from the author's perspective, that the symbolism embedded in these national emblems points to an underlying foundation in this ancient pagan mythology and its associated concept of salvation through knowledge and sin management rather than biblical repentance.

## _Roman Catholic Influence on US_

Based on the provided sources, the influence of Roman Catholicism on the United States, as argued by the author, is deep, pervasive, and often subliminal, dating back to the nation's founding and continuing into modern times. The central thesis posits that the Roman Catholic Church, particularly through the Society of Jesus (Jesuits, often referred to as the "black papacy"), has orchestrated significant historical events and embedded its symbolism and political philosophy within the core of American government and society.

One significant area of alleged influence is the very location and symbolism of the U.S. capital. The land now known as the District of Columbia reportedly bore the name "Rome" in 1663 property records, and a branch of the Potomac River bordering it was called "Tiber". This location was selected for the "federal city" by a commission headed by Daniel Carroll, a Roman Catholic who also owned one of the four farms on which the city was built, including the site for the Capitol building. The name "Capitol" itself is highlighted as inherently Roman, signifying a temple of Jupiter, the principal Roman god. The presence of Jupiter's mascot, the eagle, topping the House of Representatives mace and featured prominently on the Great Seal, is presented as further evidence of Roman origins.

The symbolism extends to the artwork within the Capitol building. The statue crowning the dome, "Freedom," is described as a Roman goddess created in Rome. The fresco on the interior of the dome, the "Apotheosis of Washington," painted by Constantino Brumidi (a Vatican artist with a controversial past that made him appealing to Protestant America), is interpreted as depicting George Washington undergoing a "secular version of the canonization of Ignatius Loyola". Washington is shown deified, like a Roman Caesar, surrounded by Roman deities and allegorical figures. Minerva, holding the fasces (an emblem of Roman totalitarianism), sits beside him, and is identified with the virgin goddess of the Sacred Heart, linked to Venus/Queen of Heaven and "The Mediatrix". Other Roman gods like Vulcan, Neptune, Ceres (linked to Anna, mother of Mary), and Mercury are also depicted. The goddess positioned below Washington, identified as the Goddess Immaculately Conceived (Persephone, Ceres, or Dreadnaught Mary) is seen as a "graphic realization" of Pope Pius IX's doctrine placing Mary between Christ and the Church. The Justice Department's seal and motto are interpreted through this lens of Persephone/Minerva judging the dead. "Young America," depicted as a boy with a Phrygian cap, is linked to freed Roman slaves who sacrificed individuality to Rome, a symbol also found on the Black Obelisk of Calah depicting worship of a Babylonian king. The depiction of Robert Morris with Mercury, the Trickster god, is interpreted as acknowledging Mercury's influence over the Revolution's outcome.

National emblems also contain significant symbols. The Great Seal features the eagle, linked to Jupiter and Roman imperial power. The motto "E PLURIBUS UNUM" is connected to ancient Bacchic Rites, symbolizing the resurrection of the "rational soul" (Bacchus) from "evil slime" (humanity), represented as "One from Many". The pentagram is also linked to this Bacchic idea. The motto "ANNUIT COEPTIS" is identified as a prayer to Jupiter from Virgil's _Aeneid_, spoken by Julius Ascanius, an ancestor claimed by Julius Caesar. "NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM" is taken from the Sibylline prophecies, associated with Augustus Caesar and the ushering in of a "new world order". The Seal's overall iconography is seen as representing a "Ministry of Sin," designed for sinners and aligning with the views of Jesuit political scientist Michael Novak.

The layout of Washington, D.C. itself is also presented as influenced by esoteric symbolism. Pierre-Charles L'Enfant, a Freemason whose commission for the project allegedly came through John Carroll, is said to have subdivided the city according to cabalistic symbols. The street plan reportedly forms a downward-pointing pentagram, resembling Baphomet, the Knights Templar icon, with the White House at its mouth, signifying "perverted power". The area around the Capitol is claimed to align with the number 666, the number of the "Beast" in Revelation. An ancient Babylonian/Assyrian symbol, the "Annu signature" (double-cross), is discussed as a symbol of rulership and found in U.S. government buildings like the Supreme Court, linking back to Babylonian prototypes.

The source asserts that the American Revolution and the subsequent formation of the U.S. government were part of an "ingenious Jesuit strategy," single-handedly designed and supervised by Superior General Lorenzo Ricci (the "black pope") from 1758 to 1775. This strategy involved dividing the British Empire against itself. Jesuit Robert Bellarmine's political theory that sovereignty resides in the people, who can depose rulers, is presented as the philosophical basis for the American rebellion, reaching the revolutionaries through works that refuted him, like Sir Robert Filmer's _Patriarcha_, and embraced by figures like John Locke and Algernon Sidney, ultimately influencing the Declaration of Independence.

The Carroll family, particularly Daniel, Charles, and John, are identified as crucial figures educated in "Jesuit warfare" at St. Omer's College. John Carroll, a Jesuit priest, became the first American bishop after the Revolution and is described as the Holy See's direct representative in the U.S.. His ordination is viewed as instituting a "secular church ruled by the black papacy". The fear among American Protestants of the Church of England appointing an American bishop is portrayed as a key event manipulated by Ricci to foment rebellion, ultimately leading to the establishment of both Anglican and Roman Catholic bishops in the U.S., a perceived victory for Rome.

The disestablishment of the Society of Jesus by Pope Clement XIV in 1773 is described as a calculated ruse orchestrated by Ricci to remove the perceived threat of the Jesuits in the eyes of Protestants, allowing them to gain influence in a secularized capacity. This event led to Jesuits rising to secular prominence in various fields, some allegedly crossing the Atlantic to guide the formation of the U.S. as a "Febronian, Bellarminian democratic republican Church-State".

The source also suggests Jesuit involvement in the Lincoln assassination. Mary Surratt's boarding house is identified as a meeting place for the conspirators, and her Jesuit confessor, Father B.F. Wiget, is also claimed to have spiritually directed John Wilkes Booth, who was found with a Catholic medal on his person after his death. President Lincoln is quoted as believing the Civil War was orchestrated by the "Pope of Rome, his Jesuits and their slaves" to divide and weaken the nation.

The influence of the Jesuit educational system, the _ratio studiorum_, is highlighted. This curriculum is described as focusing on humanist learning and philosophy, subtly marginalizing Scripture and aiming to indoctrinate students to obey papal authority. This system is claimed to have been widely adopted by American colonial colleges, influencing the education of the Founding Fathers. Modern public education and media/entertainment are presented as continuing this tradition of "learning against learning," obscuring Scripture and making sin appear as an "asset in a process of self-deification," facilitating people control.

The text defines "Jesuit" based on historical dictionary definitions, highlighting terms like cunning, deceitful, equivocation, casuistry, mental reservation, and deceptive practices. These are presented as traits necessary for a "militia empowered by a declaration of war". The financial aspect is touched upon with the claim that the Rothschilds were appointed "Guardians of the Vatican Treasury" and involved in financing wars, and the depiction of Robert Morris with Mercury, the god of commerce and thieves, suggesting divine influence over American finance. The international central banking network is linked to the Templars and Jesuits, using casuistry to justify monetary manipulation.

Overall, the source argues that the U.S. government and society were deliberately founded upon Babylonian/Roman pagan principles, mediated through Roman Catholicism and the Jesuit order, rather than biblical Christianity. The system is characterized as the "rule of law," a "ministration of condemnation" directed by Satan, distinct from the Christian "ministry of reconciliation". This foundation is asserted to be openly displayed through the nation's symbols, architecture, and historical narrative for those who can discern the hidden meanings.

## _The Two Ministries_

Based on the provided source, the author identifies and examines "the two ministries" as fundamental concepts governing human interaction and institutions. These are presented as the **ministry of Condemnation** (or the rule of law) and the **ministry of Reconciliation** (associated with the Christian gospel). The source posits that these two ministries operate as opposites, working together to fulfill a divine ordination.

### **The Ministry of Condemnation (Rule of Law)**

The source describes the ministry of Condemnation as the "rulership of evil by law". It is characterized by judging and doing justice. According to the source's interpretation of Scripture, this ministry "belongs to Satan", who is an angel of light whose ministers are ministers of righteousness. Cain is identified as the "firstling" associated with Condemnation, bearing the "powers and insignia of kingship". The "strength" of the rule of law, the ministry of Condemnation, is stated to be sin. Law is seen as most vibrant when it is "ferreting out, prosecuting, and punishing crime".

This ministry enforces its authority with "deadly force" and "does not bear the sword for nothing". The source links this to the concept of a "rod of iron" with which Christ rules nations and dashes them to pieces, suggesting that Rome was Christ's "rod of iron".

The source contrasts the functions of the rule of law/Condemnation with those of the glorious gospel/Reconciliation. While the glorious gospel calls for repentance and forgiveness, the rule of law manages sinful lifestyles, achieves advantage over neighbors, conquers enemies by legal means (like war), gives while requiring reward (profit-based trade), enforces payment of debts with interest (judiciary, police), and grants forgiveness of sins in exchange for payments and penance. The rule of law, as part of Condemnation, preaches an "absentee, impersonal God of Cain, Deism, and other faiths," which includes praying to saints for intercession and preaching "In God We Trust" while potentially prohibiting Bibles in schools.

Divine association for the ministry of Condemnation is proven not by inherent spiritual power, but by "an inert substance, a seal, a pallium, a miter, a collar, a badge, the mark of Cain, the insignia of its authority to terrorize evildoers". The source connects this concept to the U.S. government's symbols like the Great Seal, stating that the Seal represents a "Ministry of Sin," aligning with the views of Jesuit political scientist Michael Novak. The Seal's iconography is interpreted as setting forth the origin, nature, purpose, and plan of American government based on Gnostic principles, with a hidden chieftain or unknown superior possessing universal authority.

According to early Christian understanding cited in the source, Rome's purpose (equated with the satanic ministry of Condemnation) was to teach God's people not to blaspheme, destroy the sinful nature, and thereby save man's spirit from eternal damnation on judgment day. Despite its association with Satan, the source concludes that the ultimate beneficiary of this system is God, who ordained the whole system in the first place.

For citizens living under the rule of law/Condemnation, the source suggests acknowledging that only Condemnation itself holds the authority to alter governmental patterns. Attempting to change the system through conventional means requires adopting the methods of Condemnation (mastering the arts of Sun-Tzu and the Trickster), but the potential for improvement within this system appears limited to cyclical periods of "pretty good times, pretty bad times".

### **The Ministry of Reconciliation**

In contrast to Condemnation, the ministry of Reconciliation is described as teaching and administering the "glorious gospel of Christ". This ministry is characterized by judging spiritually, loving, nurturing, suffering patiently, forgiving, and rejoicing in the truth. It is directly animated by the Lord operating within. Its "strength" is the power of God, not sin.

The "glorious gospel" associated with Reconciliation commands individuals to repent of sinful lifestyles, love their neighbor as themselves, love and bless their enemies, give freely without thought of reward, forgive debts and injuries, and believe in the evidence of Christ's life, death, and resurrection to enter God's family. While not everyone is drawn to this gospel, the source states that everyone is, in some way, asked to know it.

The ministry of Reconciliation does not judge executably or "do justice" in the worldly sense. It cannot punish individuals for alienating God. Its divine association is proven by "everything it does; its mere existence is its seal," unlike the physical symbols of Condemnation.

The source draws a distinction between the Christian gospel's concept of forgiveness (conditioned upon repentance, offered freely) and the Roman Catholic sacrament of Penance (where forgiveness is received in exchange for payments and penance). It suggests that Penance is more akin to Condemnation, where a confessant pleads guilty and is sentenced to penitential acts, whereas scriptural Reconciliation forgives free of charge and directs energy toward a repentant, constructive life.

### **Relationship and Dynamics**

The source asserts that the two ministries, Condemnation and Reconciliation, "work together as opposites". Condemnation is seen as operating "out from the presence of the Lord," while Reconciliation is animated by the Lord _within_. Condemnation "cannot bring us to God, but it can drive us to Him". Conversely, Reconciliation "cannot punish us for alienating God, but it can release us to Condemnation". The source mentions that there are exceptions, "Condemnors who Reconcile and Reconcilers who Condemn", noting that some Roman Catholic priests may practice "true Reconciliation" despite the church's technical definition, and that the author's own father, a lawyer (Condemnation), also sought reconciliation in relationships (Reconciliation).

Ultimately, the source suggests that one can live "intelligently, freely, and safely in a World legitimately governed by the Trickster [Satan/Condemnation]" by understanding the two ministries, particularly through the Bible, which the source claims the "rulers of evil have suppressed". The Bible, according to the author, is the "only truthful disclosure of Satan's origin, scope, and purpose," which is why worldly rulers have traditionally discouraged its reading. The principle derived from Habakkuk is that although governing bodies may have wrong desires, one can live safely in their "faith that God will not punish them for annihilating their mortal enemies".

The ministry of Reconciliation is presented as the path for those who choose to follow the gospel commands, loving God and neighbor. By doing good as defined by the gospel, the source suggests that the "rulers of evil will commend" them.

## _What is Febronianism?_

Based on the provided source, **Febronianism** is identified as a philosophical concept and a formula for administering the Roman Catholic Church and, by extension, a blueprint for governing secular states.

Here's a detailed examination of Febronianism according to the source:

1. **Origin and Author:** Febronianism is the philosophy contained in a highly controversial book published in 1763 by a pseudonymous person, "Justinius Febronius". This pseudonym belonged to **Bishop Nikolaus von Hontheim**, who was the Chancellor of the University of Trier. The source notes that Trier University had been run by Jesuits for over a century in John Carroll's time.
2. **The Book:** The book outlining this philosophy is titled _On the State of the Church and the Legitimate Power of the Roman Pontiff_. The full title page of the first edition is presented as: _On the State of the Church and the Legitimate Power of the Roman Pontiff: A Singular Book On the Properly-Ordered Reunification with Dissidents in the Christian Religion_. The source indicates there is apparently no published English translation of the original Latin text.
3. **Core Principles:** The gist of _State of the Church_ suggests a model for decentralizing the Roman Catholic Church. It calls for organizing the Church into **independent national churches** modeled on the Church of England. Under Febronianism, these national churches are more correctly called "States" because they are ruled directly by kings and princes. The Pope is seen merely as a **principle of unity, a spiritual unifier**, with no legal jurisdiction. He is obligated to abide by the decrees of general councils, which are under the leadership of bishops and their "properly enlightened laymen".
4. **Application and Goal:** Febronianism is presented as the "secret formula for returning the non-Catholic world to the bosom of the Church". Specifically, the source interprets _On the State of the Church_ as Lorenzo Ricci's "American Manifesto", providing a social blueprint for implementing **Bellarminian liberation theology** in a Protestant monarchy. The ultimate objective is described as a "properly-ordered reunification with dissidents in the Christian religion," meaning the reunification of Roman Catholics with Protestants. This reunification would occur under a **secularized religion** whose values are described as "long on humanism, short on Scripture," taught through public schools following the Jesuit _ratio studiorum_. The source asserts that, in the eyes of the black papacy and from a Sun-Tzuan perspective, this reunification effectively equals the "practical extirpation of Protestantism".
5. **Role of Education:** Crucial to the application of Febronianism is "thorough popular education". Once laymen, bishops, and councils are "properly enlightened," they will be empowered to resist attempts by the papacy to exert monarchical control over the Church. However, the source views this from the perspective of the black papacy's hidden agenda, suggesting that this "enlightenment" actually means that laymen, bishops, and councils are indoctrinated with the understanding that their fundamental duty is the expansion of Roman Catholicism and the extirpation of Protestantism. This process is said to result in a "perfect secular political state within the Roman Catholic Church, an autocracy ruled by a monarch invisible to all but the few who, by the grace of God, cannot be deceived".
6. **Vatican Reaction (Strategic Ruse):** To mask its true purpose, the Vatican is said to have dramatically condemned Febronianism and von Hontheim's book. Pope Clement XIII, described as "jesuited," banned the book from colleges and universities. Bishop von Hontheim himself, whom few realized was Febronius, is even said to have banned the book from his own classes at the University of Trier. The source interprets this condemnation as a "rather quaint example of academic 'blown cover as cover'", a ruse to convince the public that the Church opposed Febronianism while secretly using it as a strategy.

In summary, according to the source, Febronianism, as authored by Bishop Nikolaus von Hontheim (under the pseudonym Justinius Febronius), advocates for a decentralized Roman Catholic Church structured into independent national "States" where the Pope's authority is spiritual rather than legal. The source interprets this philosophy as a calculated strategy by the Jesuit General Lorenzo Ricci and the black papacy to use education and subtle influence to bring non-Catholic populations, particularly in America, under the spiritual guidance and eventual control of Rome, effectively achieving the "reunification" of Christians by absorbing dissenters through a secularized system based on humanism and the Jesuit educational model. The public condemnation of Febronianism is presented as a deliberate deception to hide this strategic objective.

## _Reunification of Protestantism /w Catholicism_

Based on the provided source, "the plan to reunite protestants with catholicism" is discussed primarily through the concept of **Febronianism**. The source identifies this as a core strategy, particularly associated with the Jesuit General Lorenzo Ricci, for returning non-Catholic populations to the Roman Catholic Church.

Here's an examination of this plan as presented in the source:

1. **Origin and Formulation:** The plan is found within the philosophy of **Febronianism**, detailed in the controversial book _On the State of the Church and the Legitimate Power of the Roman Pontiff_. This book was published in 1763 under the pseudonym "Justinius Febronius," later identified as Bishop Nikolaus von Hontheim, Chancellor of the Jesuit-run University of Trier. The source suggests this book is "arguably Lorenzo Ricci's 'American Manifesto'", providing a social blueprint for implementing certain strategic goals. The full title page, as cited, explicitly mentions "A Singular Book On the Properly-Ordered Reunification with Dissidents in the Christian Religion".
2. **Core Mechanism - Decentralization:** Febronianism, according to the source, proposes a model for administering the Roman Catholic Church by decentralizing it into "independent national churches". These national churches are viewed more accurately as "States" because the philosophy suggests they would be ruled directly by kings and princes. In this model, the Pope is not seen as having legal jurisdiction but serves merely as a "principle of unity, a spiritual unifier". The Pope is obligated to abide by the decrees of general councils, which are under the leadership of bishops and "properly enlightened laymen".
3. **The Source's Interpretation of the True Goal:** While the outward appearance might be church reform or reconciliation, the source interprets Febronianism as the "secret formula for returning the non-Catholic world to the bosom of the Church". The "properly-ordered reunification with dissidents in the Christian religion", particularly Protestants, is seen by the source, from the perspective of the black papacy and Sun-Tzuan strategy, as the "practical extirpation of Protestantism". The ultimate goal is described as the unfolding of a "perfect secular political state within the Roman Catholic Church, an autocracy ruled by a monarch invisible to all but the few".
4. **The Role of Education and "Enlightenment":** A crucial element for the application of Febronianism is "thorough popular education". The idea is that once laymen, bishops, and councils are "properly enlightened," they will be empowered to resist papal monarchical control. However, the source provides a different interpretation of this "enlightenment." It suggests that this means the public is indoctrinated with the Jesuit _ratio studiorum_'s humanist curriculum, which prioritizes secular learning and marginalizes Scripture. This process aims to shape the understanding and mentality of individuals to respond with "unquestioning obedience to the will of the man whose fundamental duty is the expansion of Roman Catholicism and the extirpation of Protestantism". This effectively allows Roman Catholicism to control individuals without their realizing it.
5. **Strategic Deception - The Vatican's Condemnation:** To prevent the true strategic purpose of Febronianism from being widely known, the Vatican publicly condemned the book. Pope Clement XIII reportedly banned it from colleges and universities. Bishop von Hontheim (Febronius) himself even banned it from his own classes, which the source describes as a "rather quaint example of academic 'blown cover as cover'". This condemnation served as a ruse to convince the public that the Church opposed Febronianism, while it was secretly being used as a strategy. The source links this to Lorenzo Ricci's broader Sun-Tzuan strategy of feigned weakness.

In essence, the plan to reunite Protestants with Catholicism, as presented through the concept of Febronianism in the source, is interpreted not as a genuine ecumenical movement based on mutual understanding and scriptural truth, but as a calculated strategy employing political decentralization and humanist education to subtly absorb Protestantism back into the Roman Catholic system under the invisible control of the black papacy. The public face of condemnation served to mask this true intention. The source also connects this strategy to the American Revolution, suggesting it provided the blueprint for the new nation's governance structure and eventual subservience to Rome.

## _What is ratio studiorum_

Based on the provided sources and our conversation history, the **ratio studiorum** is defined and explained as the educational curriculum used by the schools and colleges of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). The term itself means "method of study" in Latin.

Here's a more detailed examination of the ratio studiorum according to the sources:

1. **Definition and Purpose:** The core definition is the method of study used in Jesuit educational institutions. Its primary purpose, as interpreted by the source, is to "obscure the moral supremacy of the Holy Bible and secure tacit obedience to the will of the black papacy". This is achieved through a strategic approach described as "learning against learning," where humanist doctrine is pitted against scriptural Christian teaching. The aim is to indoctrinate minds with the learning of "illuminated humanism as opposed to the learning of Scripture".
2. **Curriculum Content:** The curriculum prescribed in Loyola's Constitutions includes courses in various subjects:

   - Humane letters of different languages.
   - Logic.
   - Natural and moral philosophy.
   - Metaphysics.
   - Scholastic and positive theology.
   - "Sacred Scripture" is listed, but it is placed "bringing up the rear". The rigor with which Scripture is studied depends on "circumstances of times, places, persons, and other such factors", and it may be studied "either concomitantly or later on". The commentary and critical interpretation of Protestant scholars were to be ignored.

3. **Connection to Spiritual Exercises and Theatre:** The ratio studiorum embedded elements of entertainment and dramatic production, such as composition, rhetoric, and eloquence. These courses were interlinked with the Spiritual Exercises to intensify the experiential learning of Catholic doctrine over Scripture and Protestantism. This approach resulted in the development of "Jesuit theatre," a genre of spectacular plays used for indoctrination and emotional influence.
4. **Development of Obedience:** Through the ratio studiorum and the Spiritual Exercises, individuals were trained to align their thinking with papal authority and respond with "unquestioning obedience" to the will of the Jesuit Superior General. This education aimed at securing "obedience of the understanding," meaning the individual alters their perception of reality according to the superior's dictates.
5. **Influence and Impact:**

   - The curriculum of Jesuit colleges was "adopted to a great extent as the basis of the curricula in the European colleges generally".
   - Most of the American Founding Fathers were educated in colonial colleges or abroad in corresponding colleges that followed "almost exactly the Jesuit Ratio Studiorum".
   - The ratio studiorum helped turn centuries of Jesuited students into "secular philosophes", who were key figures in the Enlightenment.
   - Modern public education is seen as aiming to produce graduates who are "enlightened by the Medici Library's humanities, facile in worldly matters, moved by theatricality, and indifferent toward Holy Scripture", essentially becoming "Jesuitic graduates" by adopting the aims of the ratio studiorum.
   - Modern media content, including television, radio, print, film, stage, and web, is described as "state-of-the-art Jesuit ratio studiorum".
   - Febronianism, a concept for administering the Church and secular states, relies on "thorough popular education" indoctrinated with the ratio studiorum's humanist diet.
   - Cardinal Braschi (later Pope Pius VI), who played a key role in the Vatican during the American Revolution, was described as a "sterling product of the Jesuit colleges," and the ratio studiorum had made him a distinguished lawyer and diplomat.

In summary, the ratio studiorum is the Jesuit educational system, characterized by its emphasis on humanism, philosophy, and theology, with Scripture marginalized. Its perceived goal is to shape students' minds towards obedience to the Jesuit hierarchy and the expansion of Roman Catholicism by obscuring the importance of the Bible, influencing both religious and secular thought and institutions.

## _More on Febronianism & Return to Catholic Control_

Drawing upon the information presented in the sources and our conversation history, let's examine the concept of Febronianism, its connection to the idea of an "American Manifesto," the alleged role of Jesuit Superior General Lorenzo Ricci, and how this strategy is interpreted in the source as leading to Catholic control, particularly within the context of the United States.

### **Febronianism: The Alleged Plan for Reunification**

The source identifies **Febronianism** as a key philosophy outlining a plan for returning non-Catholic populations, specifically Protestants, to the Roman Catholic Church,. This concept is detailed in a controversial book titled _On the State of the Church and the Legitimate Power of the Roman Pontiff_, published in 1763 under the pseudonym "Justinius Febronius". The author was later identified as Bishop Nikolaus von Hontheim, who was also the Chancellor of the Jesuit-run University of Trier. The full title of the book, as cited in the source, explicitly includes the phrase "A Singular Book On the Properly-Ordered Reunification with Dissidents in the Christian Religion".

According to the source, Febronianism proposes a specific model for the administration of the Roman Catholic Church. It suggests decentralizing the Church into "independent national churches," which the source clarifies are more accurately viewed as "States" because the philosophy envisions them being ruled directly by kings and princes. In this structure, the Pope is not seen as possessing legal jurisdiction but functions primarily as a "principle of unity, a spiritual unifier". The Pope, under this model, would be required to adhere to the decisions of general councils, which are led by bishops and "properly enlightened laymen".

### **The "American Manifesto" and Lorenzo Ricci's Role**

The source posits that _On the State of the Church_ is "arguably Lorenzo Ricci's 'American Manifesto'". This suggests that the book provided a "social blueprint" for implementing certain strategic objectives, particularly regarding the unification with Protestant "dissidents",,.

Lorenzo Ricci was the Superior General of the Society of Jesus (the Black Pope) during the period leading up to and encompassing the American Revolution, from 1758 until 1775,,. The source presents Ricci as a central figure orchestrating events through an ingenious Jesuit strategy, linking him directly to the publication of Febronianism's core text,,,. The inference that Ricci was the author, or at least the driving force behind the ideas presented in Amiot's translation of Sun-Tzu (which the source connects to Ricci as a military manual,,,,), is based on the principle that a book written by a Jesuit is, "in essence," the work of his Superior General due to the vow of obedience. By extension, the source seems to apply this principle to other strategic documents perceived to serve the Jesuit agenda during Ricci's time, such as _On the State of the Church_.

The source implies that Ricci, through this "American Manifesto," intended to implement Febronianism in the North American colonies. This plan was not seen as a genuine ecumenical reconciliation but, from the perspective of the "black papacy and Sun-Tzuan strategy," as the "practical extirpation of Protestantism". The ultimate goal, according to the source, was the establishment of a "perfect secular political state within the Roman Catholic Church, an autocracy ruled by a monarch invisible to all but the few".

### **Mechanisms of Control**

The sources describe several mechanisms by which this plan was to achieve Catholic control:

1. **Political Decentralization (Febronianism):** The outward structure of independent national churches ruled by secular rulers, which in the American context translated to states ruled by laymen, created a system that appeared distinct from direct papal monarchy. However, the source argues this decentralization was a strategic ruse. By appearing less centralized and imperious than the traditional Vatican structure, the Catholic Church could become more acceptable to Protestant populations wary of papal authority. The structure of the United States government, with its division into states, is presented as an example of this Febronian model,. The source notes that the land that became the District of Columbia was originally named "Rome" in property records and bordered by a branch of the Potomac called "Rome". Key figures in the early US government were Roman Catholics educated at Jesuit colleges,,. The very architecture and symbols of the US Capitol are interpreted through a Roman pagan and Catholic lens,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,. The Vatican's official recognition as a state in the US and the presence of Roman Catholic laypersons in key government positions are presented as evidence of Rome's underlying control,,,,,,,,,,,.
2. **Manipulation through "Enlightenment" and Education:** A critical element for Febronianism's success was "thorough popular education". The idea was that "properly enlightened" laymen, bishops, and councils would be empowered to resist papal monarchical control. However, the source interprets this "enlightenment" differently. It argues that this meant indoctrinating the public with the humanist curriculum of the Jesuit [[#*What is ratio studiorum*|Ratio Studiorum]]. The `ratio studiorum` is described as the Jesuit educational method designed to "obscure the moral supremacy of the Holy Bible and secure tacit obedience to the will of the black papacy". ==It emphasizes subjects like humane letters, logic, philosophy, and theology, while marginalizing Scripture==. The source contends that this humanist education, divorced from a strong emphasis on Scripture, shapes individuals' "understanding, its mentality" to respond with "unquestioning obedience to the will of the man whose fundamental duty is the expansion of Roman Catholicism and the extirpation of Protestantism". The aim is to produce "Jesuitic graduates" who are indifferent towards Holy Scripture but facile in worldly matters and moved by theatricality. Modern public education and media content are seen as tools employing this approach,. By controlling education and information, the sources suggest Rome can subtly influence individuals and societies towards its goals without overt religious conversion.
3. **Strategic Deception and Feigned Weakness:** To allow this subtle plan to unfold, the source argues that the Vatican engaged in strategic deception. The public condemnation of Febronianism by Pope Clement XIII and Bishop von Hontheim is presented as a ruse to convince the public that the Church opposed these ideas while they were being secretly implemented,. This is linked to Lorenzo Ricci's broader "Sun-Tzuan strategy" of feigning weakness,,. The source contends that the apparent disestablishment and persecution of the Jesuits by European powers, orchestrated by Ricci himself, served as a cover to make the Society and the Catholic Church appear less threatening to Protestants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,. By appearing weak and persecuted, the Jesuits (and by extension, Rome) could gain sympathy and operate more effectively in the Protestant world, where they were previously barred from influence,,,,.
4. **Exploitation of Existing Systems and Concepts:** The plan also involved adapting and utilizing existing cultural, philosophical, and even secret societal structures. The source links Febronianism to Bellarminian liberation theology, which posits that sovereignty resides with the people who can depose unworthy rulers,. This idea, though originating from a Catholic cardinal (Robert Bellarmine), was adopted and promoted by Protestant thinkers like Algernon Sidney and John Locke,,,. The source suggests this was a deliberate strategy ("learning against learning") to make enemies of Roman Catholicism inadvertently promote Jesuit political theory,. Freemasonry is also presented as a key vehicle, described as a "sagacious recycling of the old Templar infrastructure", providing a means for Rome to control individuals outside of traditional Catholic structures,,,. The source argues that prominent American founders, many of whom were Freemasons educated in institutions using the `ratio studiorum`, were influenced by these Jesuit-promoted ideas,,.

In summary, the plan to reunite Protestants with Catholicism, as described through Febronianism in the source, is interpreted as a calculated long-term strategy driven by Jesuit Superior General Lorenzo Ricci. It involved proposing a decentralized church structure (used as a model for the US government), employing a humanist educational system (`ratio studiorum`) to shape public thought away from strict adherence to Scripture and towards obedience to the Jesuit will, utilizing strategic deception by publicly condemning Febronianism and feigning Jesuit weakness through disestablishment, and exploiting existing secular and philosophical movements (like liberation theology and Freemasonry) to subtly absorb Protestant populations. This intricate plan, according to the source, aimed not at genuine religious unity but at achieving control under the "invisible" authority of the Black Papacy,.

## _Define "missionary adaptation."_

Based on the provided sources and our conversation history, "missionary adaptation" is defined as a technique or process used by the Roman Catholic Church to bring populations under subjection to the Roman Pontiff. It involves the "adjustment of the mission subject to the cultural requirements of the mission object". The goal of this adjustment is to align the papacy's needs "as much as possible in accord with existing socially shared patterns of thought, evaluation, and action," thereby avoiding "unnecessary and serious disorganization". The source also characterizes this technique as "Playing loose with truth and Scripture".

The source argues that Rome has been so successful in adapting its mission, for instance, to American secularism, that the United States is not commonly perceived as a Catholic system, despite the author's assertion that government rosters indicate otherwise.

Several examples of missionary adaptation are provided in the sources:

- Adapting old mythic icons and pagan images to align with Bible stories and using them to spread a form of "Christianity". The source claims that what was taught to new converts through this method was an "iconic Christianity" that Scripture categorically rejects, suggesting the images were still the original pagan gods and goddesses renamed.
- The goddess Venus, for example, was allegedly absorbed into the Roman Catholic sacred tradition as the Virgin Mary through missionary adaptation, with adapters even assigning Mary the Venusian epithet "Queen of Heaven", a title the source states is only applied to the Babylonian goddess Ishtar in the Bible.
- Statues of Persephone, the Immaculate Virgin of Rome and Queen of the Dead, were re-identified and re-consecrated as the Virgin Mary by missionary adaptation.
- The goddess Ceres was reconsecrated as Anna, the mother of the Virgin Mary, through early missionary adaptation.
- The source mentions the use of the name "Mary" for the goddess Minerva through Roman Catholic missionary adaptation.

Febronianism, the philosophy of Bishop Nikolaus von Hontheim (writing as "Justinius Febronius"), is presented as containing the formula for administering Protestant America as a "Bellarminian commonwealth" through the method of missionary adaptation. This involved proposing a decentralization of the Roman Catholic Church into "independent national churches," effectively "States" ruled by laymen, where the Pope functions as a spiritual unifier rather than having legal jurisdiction. This structure, particularly the model of states ruled by laymen, is seen as a key missionary adaptation for making the Church acceptable to Protestant populations wary of papal monarchy.

The success of Febronianism depended on "thorough popular education". However, the source interprets this as indoctrinating the public with the humanist curriculum of the Jesuit `ratio studiorum`. This education, focused on humane letters, logic, and philosophy rather than the supremacy of the Bible, is seen as shaping the public's understanding to obey the will of the Jesuit Superior General, whose goal is the expansion of Roman Catholicism and the extirpation of Protestantism. The source claims this humanist diet, administered through Jesuit schools and colleges, produced students indifferent to Scripture but facile in worldly matters, contributing to the development of "secular philosophes".

In essence, missionary adaptation, as described in the sources, is a strategic, often covert, process of cultural integration and manipulation, including the adaptation of religious practices and symbols, designed to facilitate the expansion and influence of the Roman Catholic Church, ultimately bringing diverse populations under the authority of the papacy without requiring explicit religious conversion. The public condemnation of certain ideas like Febronianism is presented as a ruse to conceal their actual implementation through this subtle method.

## _Ballarminian_

Drawing on the provided sources, "Bellarminian" refers to the political theory and principles articulated by Cardinal Robert Bellarmine. Bellarmine was a Jesuit priest and theologian who became a Cardinal in 1599 and was later created a Saint in 1930.

Bellarmine's core political theory, which the source characterizes as "liberation theology," maintained that God directly granted sovereignty to the people, rather than anointing kings. According to this theory, the people are free to choose their form of government (monarchy, aristocracy, or republic) and have the right to depose a ruler or ruling entity if they prove themselves unworthy.

This theory stood in direct opposition to the doctrine of Divine Right, which Protestant kings claimed after Henry VIII's break from Rome, asserting absolute sway over their subjects as God's anointed ministers for both secular and religious purposes. Bellarmine's "democratic egalitarianism" was widely opposed by Protestant monarchs, with one notable figure, Theodore Beza, reportedly stating that Bellarmine's work, _Christian Controversy_, had "ruined" them.

According to the source, Bellarmine's liberation theology reached American revolutionaries through his principal adversary, Sir Robert Filmer. Filmer's book, _Patriarcha_, intended to defend Divine Right by refuting Bellarmine, but by quoting heavily from Bellarmine's work, it inadvertently served as a "concise introduction of Bellarminian theory". Influential figures such as Algernon Sidney and John Locke, while attacking Filmer, expounded Bellarmine's ideas, which ultimately became the philosophical rationale for the American Revolution. The source highlights direct parallels between Bellarmine's statements and concepts found in the Declaration of Independence, such as political power emanating from God but held by the people, the natural freedom and equality of all men, and the right of the people to alter or abolish a destructive government. American leaders like Thomas Jefferson and James Madison were exposed to Bellarmine's writings through figures like Filmer, Sidney, and Locke.

The source interprets the spread and adoption of Bellarminian principles in America as a deliberate and strategic Jesuit plan orchestrated by Superior General Lorenzo Ricci. The objective was to subtly influence the American colonists toward rebellion against Protestant Britain, ultimately bringing them under the influence of the black papacy.

"Bellarminian" is also used in the context of "Febronianism," the philosophy of Bishop Nikolaus von Hontheim (writing as "Justinius Febronius"). Febronianism proposed decentralizing the Roman Catholic Church into independent "national churches" (effectively "States") ruled by laymen and bishops, with the Pope acting merely as a spiritual unifier rather than having legal jurisdiction. This philosophy is presented as the "formula for administering Protestant America as a Bellarminian commonwealth" and the "social blueprint" for realizing Bellarminian liberation in a Protestant monarchy. The successful application of Febronianism, and thus the implementation of this Bellarminian system, depended on "thorough popular education" indoctrinated with the humanist curriculum of the Jesuit _ratio studiorum_. This education was intended to shape public understanding to obey the will of the Jesuit Superior General, whose goal is the expansion of Roman Catholicism and the extirpation of Protestantism.

The source further connects "Bellarminian liberation theology" to the advocacy of violence against political tyrants, noting that Central American Jesuits used posters depicting Jesus as Che Guevara to motivate campesinos to overthrow corrupt politicians. It also suggests that a sermon advocating violence against a tyrant would have "delighted Cardinal Bellarmine," linking his theory to the justification of force. The American Revolution is described as the "outworking" of this planned Bellarminian liberation. The United States is characterized as the first nation expressly designed to be a "Febronian, Bellarminian democratic republican Church-State". Even liturgical elements like the Catholic feast of Visitation Day (July 2nd) are linked by the source to Bellarminian liberation theology through Mary's sermon (the Magnificat), which contains rhetoric of rebellion against the mighty and exaltation of the humble.
