Please let me know if any of the links are not working, I've tried to keep this together as much as possible. My Spotify profile should allow you to view all of my playlists. [Urban's Spotify Profile](https://open.spotify.com/user/joshuasorber16?si=8290059b273e4cdc)

Make sure to check the different tabs at the bottom of the window, there are multiple pages.
