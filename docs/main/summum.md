## Summum Sayings

### Axiom #1

:::: thumbnail

The possession of knowledge, unless accompanied by an expression of action, is like the hoarding of precious metals -- a vain and foolish thing. Knowledge, like wealth, is intended for use. The Law of Use is universal, and those who violate it suffer by reason of their conflict with natural forces.

The teachings are not intended to be merely stored away and secreted. "If you don't use it you'll lose it." Beware of Mental Miserliness and express into action that which you have learned. Study the axioms, but practice and teach them also. Given below are some of the more important axioms with a few comments added to each. Make these your own and practice and use them, for they are not really yours until you have used and taught them.

### Axiom #2

Experience is the best teacher

The Systematic Law of Learning must be applied to all principles in order for one to have real knowledge rather than just belief. This learning requires you to first question the principle. Secondly, you must take activity in the principle and experience the action or the "cause and effect" of the principle. Thirdly, you move to a knowledge about, rather than a belief in the principle, for the principle and its workings become yours through experience.

### Axiom #3

To change your mood or mental state, change your vibration.

You may change your mental vibrations by an effort of Will, by deliberately fixing the attention upon a more desirable state. Will directs the attention and attention changes your vibration. Cultivate the Art of Attention by means of the Will, through meditation, and you have solved the secret of the mastery of moods and mental states.

### Axiom #4

Strengthen and enlarge the Will by accumulating kinetic energy from the field of all action and manifested creation.' Convert the kinetic energy into potential energy and store it in the Will through meditation.

By accumulating kinetic energy and altering it to potential energy for use by the Will, your Will may be strengthened and enlarged. Energize the attention with potential energy from the Will, then immerse the attention and the Will within . While immersed in , your Will and attention are energized with the very essences of Creation. During this immersion, kinetic energy from the field of all action and manifested creation is altered into potential energy for storage in your Will.

### Axiom #5

To alter an undesirable rate of mental vibration, put into operation the Principle of Opposition and concentrate upon the opposite point of that which you desire to suppress. Dissolve the undesirable by withdrawing your attention from it.

This is one of the most important of the formulas. It is based on true scientific principles. The mental state and its opposite are merely the two contrasting points on the same scale. By mental immersion the vibration can be altered. This principle is known to modern psychologists who apply it to the breaking up of undesirable habits by instructing their students to concentrate upon the opposing quality. If you are possessed of fear, do not waste time trying to "kill it." Instead, cultivate the quality of courage and the fear will disappear. Some writers have expressed this idea most forcibly by using the illustration of the dark room. You do not clear out darkness. Just open the curtains, let in the light, and the darkness disappears. To dissolve a negative quality, concentrate the attention on the positive point of that same quality. The vibrations will gradually change from negative to positive, until finally you become fixed on the positive point. The reverse is also true, as many have found to their sorrow when they allowed themselves to vibrate too constantly on the negative point. By changing your vibration you may master your moods, change your mental states, remake your disposition, and build up character. Much of the mental mastery of the advanced Masters is due to this application of immersion which is one of the more important aspects of mental psychokinesis. Remember the ### Axiom which says:

### Axiom #6

:::: thumbnail

Mind (as well as metal and elements) may be altered Psychokinetically, from state to state; degree to degree; proportion to proportion; condition to condition; point to point; vibration to vibration. Psychokinesis is Mental Mastery.

The mastery of immersion is the mastery of the fundamental Principle of Psychokinesis or mental alteration. For unless one acquires the art of altering their own vibration, they will be unable to affect their environment. An understanding of this principle will empower one to change their own vibration as well as that of others, if you will but devote the time, care, study, and meditative techniques necessary to master the art. The principle is true, but the results obtained depend upon the persistent patience and practice of the student.

### Axiom #7

Rhythm may be neutralized by an application of the Art of Immersion.

As explained in a previous chapter, holds that the Principle of Rhythm manifests on the mental levels as well as the physical. Further, the bewildering succession of moods, feelings, emotions, and other mental states are due to the backward and forward swing of the mental pendulum that carries you from one extreme of feeling to another. also teaches that the Law of Neutralization enables one, to a great extent, to overcome the operation of Rhythm. There are both higher and lower levels of consciousness. By rising mentally to the higher level, the Master causes the swing of the mental pendulum to manifest on the lower level, and by dwelling on the higher level, escapes the consciousness of the swing backward. This is effected by immersing in the higher self, and thus raising the mental vibrations of the ego above those of the ordinary levels of consciousness. It is similar to the process of rising above a force and allowing it to pass beneath you. The advanced students immerse themselves at the positive point of their being -- the point of spirit -- rather than the point of personality. By refusing to participate in the operation of Rhythm, they raise themselves above its level of function. Standing firm in their statement of being, they allow the pendulum to swing back upon the lower levels without changing their fixed position of immersion. This is accomplished by all individuals who have attained any degree of self mastery, whether they understand the law or not. Such persons simply refuse to allow themselves to be swung back by the pendulum of mood and emotion, and by steadfastly affirming the superiority of spirit, they remain fixed on the positive point. The Masters, of course, attain a far greater degree of proficiency, because they understand the law which they are overcoming through the use of a higher law. By use of their Will, they attain a degree of poise and mental steadfastness almost impossible to believe by those who allow themselves to be swung backward and forward by the mental pendulum of moods and feelings.

Remember always, however, that you do not really destroy the Principle of Rhythm, for that is indestructible. You simply overcome one law by counterbalancing it with another, thus maintaining an equilibrium. The laws of balance and counterbalance are in operation on the mental as well as on the physical levels. An understanding of these laws seemingly enables one to "overthrow" laws, while in fact they are merely exerting a counterbalance.

### Axiom #8

:::: thumbnail

Nothing escapes the Principle of Cause and Effect (Destiny), but there are many levels of the law, and one may use laws of the higher to overcome the laws of the lower.

An understanding of the practice of immersion allows you to rise to a higher level of Cause and Effect and thus counterbalance the laws of the lower levels. By rising above the level of ordinary causes you become, to a degree, a cause instead of an effect. Able to master your own moods and feelings and to neutralize Rhythm, you are able to escape a great part of the operation of Cause and Effect on the ordinary level. The masses are carried along, obedient to their environment. The wills and desires of others overpower them, and the effects of memory and inherited tendencies rule them so that they tend to move about on the chessboard of life like mere pawns. By rising above these influencing causes, the advanced student seeks a higher level of mental action and direction. Dominating their moods, emotions, impulses, and feelings, they create for themselves new characters, qualities, and powers through which they overcome their environment. They now become the players instead of mere pawns. Such people assist in the game of life, instead of being moved about this way and that by stronger influences, powers, and wills. They use the Principle of Cause and Effect instead of being used by it. Of course, even the highest are subject to the Principle as it manifests on the higher levels. But on the lower levels of activity they are masters instead of slaves. As says:

The wise serve on the higher, but rule on the lower. They obey the laws coming from above them, but on their own level and those below them they rule and give orders. Yet in so doing, they form a part of the Principle instead of opposing it. The wise fall in with the Law, and by understanding its movements operate it instead of being its blind slave. Just as the skilled swimmer turns this way and that way, goes and comes at will rather than being carried like a floating log, so are the wise as compared to the novice. Yet both swimmer and log, wise and fool, are subject to Law. Those who understand this are well on the road to Mastery.

### Axiom #9

:::: thumbnail

True Psychokinesis is a Mental Art.

In the above axiom, teaches that the great work of influencing one's environment is accomplished by mental power. The universe being wholly mental, it follows that it may be ruled only by mentality. In this fact is to be found an explanation of all the phenomena and manifestations of the various mental powers. In back of and underneath the teachings of the various disciplines remains ever constant the principle of the mental substance of the universe. If the universe be mental in its essence, then it follows that mental alteration must change the condition and phenomena of the universe. If the universe is mental, then mind must be the highest power affecting its events. If this be understood then all the so called "miracles" and "wonder workings" are seen plainly for what they are.

### Axiom #10

There is no why. It merely is and is not.

Why does do what It does? Why is there life? Why is there being? These can be difficult questions to answer, and can be dealt with by saying that the questions are their own answers. does for the cause of doing. Life is the reason for life. Being is for the cause of being. These can be difficult and perplexing considerations. Just know that you can "be" with these concepts, and through practicing the ideal meditation attain the realization that everything is and is not, simply because it is and is not -- It is the result of Creation's copulation.

### Axiom #11

is INFINITE, LIVING MIND. The universe is mental. The Summa Individuals call It SPIRIT!

Your new physics, that of quantum mechanics, has proposed startling new theories, so far as the scientific world is concerned, dealing with the behavior of the universe and the nature of reality. Quantum physicists are now faced with the conclusion that "reality" is a product of consciousness. Their study of subatomic particles, or more recently, quanta particles, suggests to them that these particles, as small as they appear, have a consciousness entirely their own. Such being the case at the quantum particle level, it must follow that all matter and energy in the physical universe has its own collective consciousness, since matter and energy are but groupings of these quanta particles. Therefore, the material universe itself has a consciousness all its own. Quantum physicists are faced with the question of the source of the consciousness of matter.

As your physicists continue in their search for the source of the consciousness of matter, they will discover that all matter has spirit. This spirit they try to understand as a form of consciousness. The collective spirit of all the units and groupings of units is . It is this collective consciousness which makes up the INFINITE, LIVING MIND which is . is not some sort of "giant brain in the sky," but rather the Life Force energy produced by the event of the bonding between NOTHING and POSSIBILITY. Just as your consciousness is much more encompassing than the organ that is called your brain, so is the INFINITE, LIVING MIND of that much greater than all the collective raw particles of the universe. is infinite consciousness in all its varied aspects. The Summa Individuals call It SPIRIT!

### Axiom #12

Creation manifests when balance is perfected between the opposites. By applying higher Law against lower laws the creation becomes divine.

Under and behind all outward appearances or expressions of existence, behind all events, behind all circumstances, is the substantial essence -- the bonding between Nothing and Possibility. It is for this reason that the universe is dual in its nature, and it is for this reason that spiritual development requires you to become conscious of that duality. Whenever you examine anything, be aware of the duality of that which you observe. Be aware of the two opposites which make it up to be what it is. Remember, where you find one thing, you will always find its opposite.

By recognizing the duality of the universe, you can begin to look for the opposites in all events or circumstances, remembering always that the opposites are merely differing aspects of the same thing or event. In identifying the opposites, you can strive for balance between the two. Your perfection of balance between the opposites is achieved by the practice of the ideal meditation, for this practice will bring you to the point of equilibrium between body, mind, and spirit. This practice will move you to a perspective that is unencumbered by judgments and the constraints of a fixed mind.

As you perfect your balance between the opposites, be ever aware of the correspondence between the levels of life and being. Keep in mind that the same principles are in effect at all the various fields and levels. Utilize the Principle of Correspondence to reason from the known to the unknown and observe the laws as they operate on each level. Apply the law of a higher level against that of a lower level for the law of a higher level dominates the lower.

In perfecting your practice of the ideal meditation and becoming intimate with the Principles, you will develop the powers of spiritual psychokinesis. Thus, you are able to easily and more readily use Law against laws, the higher against the lower, and create a life and direction of your choosing. In such a position, you are most certainly in harmony with nature and truly your creations become divine.
