## Detailed Timeline

### **Ancient History (Pre-Adamic to c. 1200 B.C.)**

- **Pre-Adamic Era:** Samjaza (Satan), leader of 200 angels (Watchers), descends on Mt. Carmel and mates with human women, producing the Nephilim (giants). These unions introduce magic, cannibalism, and extreme violence.
- **Creation of Cain:** Satan, in serpent form, seduces Eve, leading to the birth of Cain, the first murderer, establishing a demonic presence on Earth. Cain is reputed to have celebrated the first Black Mass.
- **The Flood (Tarim Basin):** God sends a flood to punish corrupted humanity, saving Noah and his pure-blooded Adamic family.
- **Ham's Transgression & Curse of Canaan:** On the Ark, Noah's son Ham has intercourse with a pre-Adamite woman, resulting in Cush (who is black-skinned). After the flood, Ham's son Canaan commits a homosexual act on a drunken Noah, leading Noah to curse Canaan and his descendants to slavery.
- **Rise of Nimrod:** Cush's son, Nimrod (born December 25th), inherits garments from Adam and Eve, granting him invincibility and making him the first man to rule the world. He founds Babylon and Nineveh, introduces genocide, ritual murder, and cannibalism (the word "cannibal" derived from "Canaan" and "Baal"). He is also credited with founding Freemasonry.
- **Tower of Babel & Nimrod's Execution:** Nimrod builds the Tower of Babel in defiance of God. Shem, Noah's eldest son, executes Nimrod, dismembers his body, and sends the pieces to pagan temples as a warning.
- **Origin of Mystery Cults & Gnosticism:** Nimrod's priests hide his body pieces as relics, forming secret "Mystery cults" dedicated to his worship, conducting orgies and child sacrifices underground. This marks the origin of Gnosticism (the "Knowing Ones").
- **Shem Founds Egypt:** Shem, described as tall, fair-haired, and blue-eyed, founds and builds the civilization of Egypt, ruling as the first Pharaoh (Menes/Khufu) and building the Great Pyramid at Gizeh. He campaigns against the barbaric practices introduced by Naamah and Nimrod.
- **Canaanite Expansion and Practices:** The Canaanites spread their demon-worship, occult rites, child sacrifice (to Moloch/Milcom), and cannibalism, particularly in Egypt. Their demonology includes Lilith (vampire, chief demoness, first wife of Adam).
- **Canaanite Will:** Canaan leaves a will to his sons, outlining a formula for vice: "Love one another (of this tribe only), love robbery, love lewdness, hate your masters, and do not speak the truth." This becomes the blueprint for their operations.
- **Persecution of Shemites:** After Shem's death, the Egyptian priests (Canaanites) launch campaigns to erase his name from history and persecute his fair-haired descendants.
- **Canaanites Become Phoenicians (c. 1200 B.C.):** The Canaanites change their name to Phoenicians, gaining a monopoly on purple dye and establishing trading colonies across the Mediterranean. They continue their demon-worship in secret.

### **Classical Antiquity to Middle Ages**

- **Punic Wars (264-201 B.C.):** Rome attacks Carthage, the most important Phoenician colony, ultimately destroying the city and sowing the land with salt. This instills a fierce hatred of all things Roman ("fascism") in the Canaanites.
- **Babylonian Captivity (586-537 B.C.):** After the fall of Jerusalem, Jews are taken captive to Babylon, where Canaanite tribes intermarry, leading to confusion about customs.
- **Formation of the Talmud:** During and after the Babylonian captivity, a great book of religious teachings, the Talmud, is compiled, incorporating many elements of Babylonian demonology and Mystery cults. The Mishnah (oral law) teaches not to reveal "the work of creation" or "the work of the chariot" to the uninitiated.
- **Rise of the "Black Nobility":** The Venetians, descendants of the Canaanites, establish Venice (466 A.D.) as a commercial hub and money-lending center. By 1171, they become known as "the black nobility" due to their Canaanite origin and ruthless pursuit of wealth and power. They infiltrate European noble families.
- **The Zohar (1280 A.D.):** A further development of Talmudic thought, The Zohar (Cabala/Kabbalah), appears, emphasizing fertility rites and the precept that Israel alone will possess the future world.

- **Teutonic Knights:** The people of Shem establish organizations like the Teutonic Knights, known as invincible warriors.
