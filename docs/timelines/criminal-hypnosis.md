## Detailed Timeline of Main Events

### **Ancient Times - 1500 BC:**

- **Ancient Civilizations (Egypt, Chaldea, Abyssinia):** Sophisticated induction methods and trance management skills were used. Bas-relief on a tomb at Thebes shows a priest inducing hypnosis. Chaldean magicians manipulated trance subjects, and Abyssinian fakirs used hypnotic techniques to enslave people.

### **1493:**

- **Birth of Paracelsus:** He is recognized as the first person to scientifically describe and define unethical hypnosis, distinguishing between "white magic" (benevolent medical use) and "black magic" (exploitative control).

### **1700s:**

- **Emergence of Mesmerism in France:** Mesmer and his disciples introduce "animal magnetism," believing it involves an invisible magnetic fluid and can cause irrepressible sexual desire in women, leading to "crises." Induction techniques are developed to maneuver female subjects toward expected sexual arousal.
- **1787: Posthypnotic Suggestions Described.**
- **1790: Luys Invents First Mechanical Induction Devices:** This includes the metronome and a hypnodisc with spinning lights.

### **Late 1700s:**

- **Marquis de Puysegur's Contributions:** Debunks Mesmer's beliefs about erotic abandon and "crises." Discovers and defines "artificial somnambulism" (later renamed hypnosis by Braid). Develops a new understanding of trance phenomena and medical applications, creating the first psychological theory of hypnosis. He emphasizes using rapport for good and his students adopt a quiet, medical style of trance management.

### **1807:**

- **Transfer of Rapport Described by Puysegur:** The ability to shift control of a somnambulist from one hypnotist to another through verbal suggestion is documented.

### **1815:**

- **Death of Franz Anton Mesmer:** His disciples spread mesmerism globally, some as scientific hypnosis, others as spiritualism or to call up spirits. Mesmer's work shifts the focus from magic/religion to scientific understanding of hypnosis, initiating "dynamic (unconscious) psychiatry."

- **Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA):** Began in 1957 as a highly secretive network of defense scientists, industrial contractors, and university researchers focused on military defense-oriented research, including mind-reading technology.
- **ARTICHOKE:** An early CIA hypnosis research program, predating BLUEBIRD, which aimed to develop techniques for disguised induction, hypnotic memory training, and sealing.
- **BLUEBIRD:** A CIA hypnosis research program organized in 1950, directed by Morse Allen, focusing on risky experiments and "terminal experiments" beyond ethical limits.
- **Central Intelligence Agency (CIA):** A U.S. intelligence agency involved in extensive, secretive mind-control research (MKULTRA, BLUEBIRD, ARTICHOKE, Operation Often), including drug-hypnosis, artificial personality splitting, and the use of unknowing agents.
- **Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI):** Hoover attempted to expand its intelligence-gathering into a worldwide team, competing with the CIA.
- **MKULTRA:** A long-lasting, complex, and lavishly-financed CIA program in mind-control research, authorized by Allen Dulles in 1953. It was exempted from normal financial controls and involved a wide range of unethical experiments.
- **National Security Agency (NSA):** A highly secretive U.S. intelligence agency with a long history of operating outside public oversight and legal constraints. It is heavily involved in signals intelligence (SIGINT), electronic mind-reading, and the suppression of inventions.
- **Office of Strategic Services (OSS):** A U.S. intelligence agency during WWII, authorized by President Roosevelt, for intelligence gathering and secret scientific research with military applications. It was later shut down by Truman.
- **Operation Often:** A CIA mind-control experiment that began in 1969, involving a team of Agency scientists conducting bizarre experiments, including the extensive conditioning and torture of a female subject using disorientation, capacity regression, and aversive conditioning.
- **SIGINT (Signals Intelligence):** A division of the NSA responsible for electronic intelligence gathering and advanced mind-control technologies, including remote neural monitoring and brainwave synchronization devices.

### **Other Notable Figures and Terms:**

- **Anna O.:** A patient of Breuer and Freud, whose case demonstrated the healing potential of expressing and integrating repressed traumatic memories ("abreaction").
- **Corinne:** A woman who experienced a therapist making suggestive and inappropriate remarks during a hypnosis session, leading her to terminate the treatment and raising concerns about the therapist's ethics.
- **Geert-Jorgensen:** A member of Nielsen's defense team who tried to dismiss hypnosis in the Palle Hardwick case, attributing Palle's actions to fabricating stories.
- **John Nebel ("Long John" Nebel):** Candy Jones's husband, a New York nighttime radio personality, who helped her recover memories of her CIA hypnoprogramming and tape-recorded her trance revelations.
- **Melina:** A "psychic" and former head teacher at the Berkeley Psychic Institute, who taught students how to block displacement and mind-reading attempts, and observed others attempting mind-to-mind inductions.
- **Snowflake:** The cook's little girl, who sometimes played with Jessica (Candy Jones) during winters when Jessica was not allowed school friends home.
- **Titte:** Nielsen's wife, who was aware of and presumably complicit in his hypnotic manipulation of Palle Hardwick.
- **X:** The pseudonymous "guardian spirit" that Nielsen invented to control Palle Hardwick, portraying himself as the conduit for divine orders, effectively acting as Palle's induction cue to deep amnesic trance.
