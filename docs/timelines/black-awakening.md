The provided text is an excerpt from a book by **Russ Dizdar** titled **"The Black Awakening: Rise of the Satanic Super Soldiers and the Coming Chaos"**, published in **2009**, which centers on a fundamentalist Christian perspective concerning an imminent global catastrophe. The author contends that an ancient, **satanic conspiracy** is actively working to bring about a **New World Order** ruled by the **Antichrist**, which will be preceded by a period of massive global **chaos** known as the **Black Awakening** or "great revolt." This agenda is being carried out by a secret army of **"chosen ones"** or **"satanic super soldiers"**—individuals created through trauma-based **mind control** (such as **MK-ULTRA** and **Satanic Ritual Abuse** or **SRA**) and **demonic possession**—who are embedded globally, often as "sleepers," ready to be **triggered** to unleash unprecedented violence and societal collapse. The author urges readers to embrace **Biblical prophecy**, spiritual warfare, and **aggressive physical preparation** (such as storing food and water) as countermeasures against this impending, supernaturally charged global war against God.

This text, "The Black Awakening: Rise of the Satanic Super Soldiers and the Coming Chaos" by Russ Dizdar, presents a dire prophetic warning about an impending global **spiritual and societal collapse**. The central thesis claims that an ancient, **luciferian conspiracy** is actively creating a massive, covert army of **"chosen ones" or "satanic super soldiers"** through trauma-based mind control and ritual abuse, primarily Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) victims. These super soldiers, often unknowingly placed as "sleepers" in institutions like the military and the Church, are allegedly trained to cause the **"black awakening"—a global chaos or revolt**—which will usher in a New World Order led by the Antichrist. The author asserts that this supernatural conflict is intensifying, drawing parallels between modern military mind control projects like MK Ultra and Nazi occult ideology, and urges readers to prepare both spiritually and physically, emphasizing the power of Christ and the need for **aggressive spiritual warfare** against this pervasive evil.

## Understanding the Key Players in 'The Black Awakening'

This document provides a detailed analysis of the four primary groups of individuals described in Russ Dizdar's apocalyptic narrative, _The Black Awakening_. Within this text, Dizdar constructs a global, supernaturally-charged conflict unfolding between distinct factions. The purpose of this analysis is to clarify the unique roles, defining characteristics, and core motivations of each group as presented in the source material, offering a structured guide to the key players in this eschatological drama.

### 1. The 'Chosen Ones': Satan's Super Soldiers

Within Russ Dizdar's narrative, the 'Chosen Ones' are constructed as the primary antagonists, a cadre of mind-controlled, supernaturally-empowered agents designed to initiate a global cataclysm.

#### 1.1. Core Identity and Purpose

Dizdar defines this group directly and unambiguously, stating that _"'Chosen Ones’ are those so named because they are ‘chosen by satan’ to serve him."_ Their central purpose, according to the text, is to function as the elite troops for the Antichrist, a coming world leader, with the explicit mission of triggering a worldwide period of chaos to collapse existing societal structures. The narrative frames this role as their ultimate destiny, a self-perception emphasized in their own declaration:

"We are the legions who will rule the earth"

#### 1.2. Origins and Creation

According to the text, a 'Chosen One' does not emerge by accident but is the product of a deliberate and brutal process of "transmutation." Their origins are rooted in a dark, intergenerational system.

- **Bloodlines:** They are sourced from "old bloodlined satanic (Luciferianism) groups" that Dizdar asserts are committed to a new world order.
- **Abuse and Mind Control:** They are described as victims of lifelong "satanic ritual abuse and soul ripping mind control."
- **Purposeful Creation:** The narrative posits that they are "selected, born and raised in this dark system" and are "purposely created and highly trained" for their specific roles.
- **Psychological State:** As a direct result of this trauma-based conditioning, they have been deliberately "split and have many sub personalities (multiple personality disorder)."

#### 1.3. Defining Characteristics and Abilities

The 'Chosen Ones' are depicted as possessing a unique and formidable set of characteristics that distinguish them from ordinary individuals. These traits are presented as a combination of psychological conditioning, rigorous training, and supernatural empowerment. Many function as "sleepers," their true nature hidden until activated, as Dizdar illustrates with narrative examples such as a female assassin who attempts to kill him or a soldier who shoots his own mother on global television.

| Key Characteristics of a Chosen One | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Psychological State**             | Suffer from Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD), with numerous sub-personalities that have been individually programmed and can be triggered to perform specific tasks.                                                                                                          |
| **Physical Appearance**             | When an activated personality is in control, their appearance reportedly transforms. Dizdar provides the example of "Joe," a police officer whose face becomes "dark and menacing" with "black glassy eyes" and a "contorted menacing face" just before murdering his colleague. |
| **Training & Abilities**            | They are described as "highly trained," "very fast, furious," and possessing enhanced physical capabilities. The text also attributes to them psychic abilities and supernatural powers derived from rituals.                                                                    |
| **Spiritual State**                 | Described as "demonized," they are not considered "fully human." Their being is infused with a dark spiritual presence that animates their actions and fuels their mission.                                                                                                      |
| **Programming**                     | Their minds are layered with complex programming, including "suicide programming" designed to be triggered to eliminate them if they are captured or their mission is complete.                                                                                                  |

#### 1.4. The Ultimate Mission: 'The Black Awakening'

From the perspective of the 'Chosen Ones,' 'The Black Awakening' is the culmination of their existence. It is a planned, global "hell on earth event," a coordinated wave of chaos designed to shatter governments, cripple infrastructure, and collapse society. Their function is to be the primary agents of this destruction.

_"they confess they are the troops of the coming antichrist, which they say are here to unleash hell on earth, in a chaos…such as the world has never seen."_

The narrative explains that while some 'Chosen Ones' fight to break free from their conditioning, many embrace their role, viewing it as a "badge of honor." They believe their participation will secure them a "privileged position" in the new world order that will rise from the ashes. These super-soldiers are not self-created; Dizdar's narrative establishes that they are the product of a shadowy order with a far grander agenda.

### 2. The Perpetrators: The Shadow Order

This group represents the masterminds behind the chaos Dizdar describes—the architects of the 'Chosen Ones' and the driving force behind the push for a new global regime.

#### 2.1. Identity and Motivation

The text uses several overlapping terms to describe this clandestine group, including "luciferians," "illuminists," "handlers," and "splitters/programmers." It also notes that many have "Nazi origins." They operate as a shadow government, having infiltrated all levels of society. According to the narrative, their primary motivation is to orchestrate a global collapse to bring about "a new order out of the chaos," which is described as a "satanic phoenix rising." Their ultimate goal is "total control" and, in their hubris, to "take the seat of God." The text posits that their entire worldview is built on a supernatural foundation:

"There is no globalism without the supernatural spiritual force behind it"

#### 2.2. Methods of Operation

This shadow order, as depicted by Dizdar, employs a combination of psychological manipulation, clandestine infiltration, and dark spiritual practices to achieve its objectives.

1. **Creation of 'Chosen Ones':** They use systematic "satanic ritual abuse" (SRA) and advanced "mind control" technology on victims from birth. This trauma is intentionally used to induce "multiple personality disorder" (MPD), which allows them to create and program different personalities within a single person, turning them into controllable assets.
2. **Secrecy and Infiltration:** Their operations are protected by a deep secrecy, described as a "thick dark power that covered them." They have successfully infiltrated key societal structures, with perpetrators acting as "doctors, priests, psyches and military men." Dizdar illustrates the terrifying depth of this infiltration with a narrative vignette in which "trusted agents" turn on senators and gun them down inside a secure government bunker.
3. **Ritual and Dark Magic:** They rely on secret rituals to "prepare them and empower them." The narrative states that the shedding of "innocent blood" is central to these rituals, which are used to gain supernatural power and advance their plans.

#### 2.3. The Connection to Nazism

Dizdar employs a key narrative device by drawing a direct line between this modern shadow order and the occult underpinnings of the Nazi regime, thereby lending his contemporary apocalyptic scenario historical weight. The specific technology for creating programmable doubles and the broader spiritual agenda are linked to the "old the old Nazi's." The text asserts this connection is not merely ideological but supernatural, claiming the agenda was "originated and designed by a corrupted intelligence...and it was not human." The 'Chosen Ones' themselves are portrayed as perceiving their capabilities as a terrifying evolution of this legacy, with one quoted as saying:

"We will make Hitler’s SS troops look like choir boys"

While the perpetrators operate from the shadows, their methods are said to create a vast population of traumatized individuals.

### 3. The Victims: SRA/MPD Sufferers

This group represents the raw material for the perpetrators' plans as described in the text. They are individuals subjected to Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA) who develop Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD) as a result of extreme trauma.

#### 3.1. The Experience of Victimization

The general profile of a victim is one of profound suffering. They endure "trauma based split personality" and are used in "satanic blood and sex rituals." The narrative emphasizes that this is not an isolated phenomenon but a widespread conspiracy, citing the "thousands of horror stories" that have surfaced.

"You surely can’t have two million or more cases of trauma based split personality with detailed stories of satanic rituals and not have massive conspiracy behind it!"

#### 3.2. The Struggle for Freedom

The path to recovery for these victims is depicted as being fraught with peril. The text notes that "Some got free but just as many didn’t." Speaking out against their abusers carries the ultimate threat: "To tell was to die." Despite the danger, their courage is acknowledged as a crucial warning to others.

"To all those victims who have been fighting their way out of the darkness. You are brave and have helped give warning to others."

#### 3.3. The Victim-to-Perpetrator Spectrum

Dizdar makes a critical distinction in the narrative: the line between victim and perpetrator can become blurred. While many are described as "sad victims" desperate for help, others are conditioned to embrace their new, empowered identity. The text reports that some explicitly told the author that "they had worked on this for many years and many of them vowed they wouldn’t give up their hard fought for abilities." This statement directly connects the broader victim population to the highly specialized and loyal 'Chosen Ones,' illustrating how Dizdar constructs the pathway through which a victim can be transformed into a willing agent of the shadow order.

Opposing this dark agenda and seeking to aid its victims is a group motivated by a completely different spiritual source.

### 4. The Christian Believers: The Resistance

Within the narrative, Christian believers are depicted as the primary resistance force, standing in direct opposition to the luciferian conspiracy.

#### 4.1. Core Beliefs and Source of Strength

Their motivation and power are derived entirely from their faith. They believe in Jesus Christ as the "Savior of the world" and "God in human flesh." This faith is their anchor in the midst of the described chaos. Their core practices are prayer and reliance on scripture; they "prayed long and hard against this evil," and in the face of collapse, the Bible became "important to many now."

#### 4.2. Role in the Conflict

The believers in this narrative are not passive observers waiting for rescue. They are actively engaged in the conflict on multiple fronts.

- **Awareness and Preparation:** They are described as those who "see what I see and know what time it is." This awareness leads to practical preparation, with stocked food and water, as well as spiritual readiness through prayer.
- **Active Opposition:** They take a direct role in confronting the perpetrators. The text states that they "hunt them" and actively "interrupt" their dark rituals. Their stance is summarized by the phrase: "a sword in one hand and a brick in the other, defend and build."
- **Providing Aid:** They work to help victims escape their captors and programming. Their homes become safe havens for those fleeing the chaos and seeking refuge.
- **Spiritual Warfare:** They are engaged in a direct supernatural conflict. They are able to discern evil plots and are described as "fiercely praying against that dark presence they felt."

#### 4.3. Ultimate Hope

Ultimately, their hope is not placed in their own preparations or strength but in the prophesied return of Jesus Christ. They stand firm against the darkness, "energized by Truth knowing that another Ancient One, THE ANCIENT OF DAYS, would soon take His place." Their actions are framed as a holding pattern against evil, rooted in the belief that a final, divine victory is inevitable.

In his narrative of _The Black Awakening_, Russ Dizdar constructs an intense, Manichaean conflict between meticulously defined forces. He presents a world divided between a luciferian 'Shadow Order' that creates a mind-controlled army of 'Chosen Ones' and a resistance of 'Christian Believers' who seek to redeem the 'Victims' caught in the middle. Each group serves as a direct foil to another, creating a starkly dualistic framework: the Shadow Order’s act of satanic creation is pitted against the Believers' mission of divine redemption, while the Chosen Ones’ pre-programmed servitude stands in direct contrast to the Victims’ struggle for free will. The narrative frames this clash not merely as a geopolitical struggle but as the culmination of a spiritual war—a final battle between the forces of God and the legions of Satan, with the fate of humanity hanging in the balance.

### 6 Chilling Takeaways from a Look into the World of Satanic Super Soldiers

Many look at the world today and see a disturbing acceleration of chaos. From political polarization and economic instability to a pervasive sense of societal breakdown, it often feels as if events are spiraling out of control, driven by forces too large and random to comprehend. It’s a common sentiment to feel that the systems designed to provide order are themselves collapsing into unpredictable turmoil.

While conventional analysis points to political failures or economic cycles, some sources propose a far more structured and sinister explanation. Russ Dizdar’s 2009 book, _The Black Awakening_, presents a worldview where the apparent chaos is not random at all but is the meticulously engineered outcome of a hidden war. It describes a deep conspiracy operating in the shadows, built on centuries of occult planning and advanced mind control.

What follows are six of the most unsettling takeaways from this text. They form the pillars of a narrative that connects satanic ritual, psychological trauma, and a prophesied final battle for the future of humanity. It is an exploration of a framework that seeks to impose a terrifying order on a seemingly senseless world.

#### **1. A Secret Army of "Chosen Ones" Exists**

The central claim of the text is the existence of a secret army, referred to as the "Chosen Ones." These are not willing volunteers but individuals born into ancient satanic bloodlines who, from birth, have been subjected to intense satanic ritual abuse (SRA) and what the author calls "soul ripping mind control." This process is deliberately designed to fracture their psyche, creating what is clinically known as Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), formerly Multiple Personality Disorder.

According to this worldview, this fracturing is not a disorder but a deliberate "transmutation"—an alteration of the human soul to create a new type of being. The resulting alternate personalities are not merely a byproduct of trauma; they are the objective. These "sub personalities" are systematically programmed, conditioned, and demonized to become hidden soldiers, their minds a battlefield where loyalty is forged through terror. The text defines their self-professed mission in stark terms:

_‘Chosen Ones’ are those so named because they are ‘chosen by satan’ to serve him... they confess they are the troops of the coming antichrist, which they say are here to unleash hell on earth, in a chaos…such as the world has never seen._

This narrative move is critical; it co-opts the language of clinical psychology, lending a veneer of scientific legitimacy to a purely supernatural claim, thereby grounding an esoteric conspiracy in a recognized, real-world trauma. It reframes a severe psychological condition not as an illness to be healed, but as the very foundation of a weaponized army.

#### **2. Their Mission: Engineer a Global Collapse Called "The Black Awakening"**

The chaos these "Chosen Ones" are programmed to unleash is not random violence. It is a meticulously planned, coordinated event with a specific name: "The Black Awakening." The book paints a visceral, novelistic picture of this event: a sudden, society-shattering wave of attacks executed simultaneously across the world. The goal is not just disruption, but total societal collapse.

The narrative describes a world plunged into darkness overnight. A seasoned police captain watches in horror as his longtime friend, eyes "black and glazed over," guns down a fellow officer without hesitation. In what was supposed to be a secure underground bunker, trusted Secret Service agents wait for the blast doors to shut before turning their weapons on the senators they were sworn to protect. A pastor, hunted in his own home, is shot while escaping with his family, recognizing the attackers as men who had been attending his church just weeks before.

The explicit goal of this engineered collapse is to create a power vacuum so complete and terrifying that a desperate global population will beg for a savior to restore order. This is presented as the ultimate takeover—a global coup designed to destroy the existing world and usher in a "new order out of the chaos." It is a mission declared by the soldiers themselves in a chilling proclamation:

“WE ARE THE LEGIONS WHO WILL RULE THE EARTH.”

#### **3. The Technology's Roots Are in Nazi Occultism**

According to the book, the core technology used to create these super soldiers is not a modern invention. The trauma-based mind control and personality-splitting techniques are traced directly back to Nazi occultism and the horrific human experiments conducted by doctors like the infamous "Dr. Green." This technique, referred to as "doubling"—the ability to "act in two separate and distinct ways for different purposes"—allowed Nazi doctors to commit atrocities while maintaining the psychological veneer of a healer.

The text claims that this "black flame" technology was secretly absorbed into the U.S. intelligence apparatus after World War II through operations that brought Nazi scientists to America. This knowledge then allegedly formed the basis for clandestine projects that perfected the creation of mind-controlled operatives. The soldiers created through this process see themselves not merely as assets but as the ideological heirs to Nazism—a new, superior "master race" of warriors destined to succeed where the Third Reich failed. Their own words capture this sense of evolved brutality:

“We will make Hitler’s SS troops look like choir boys”

By tethering the conspiracy to the well-established evil of the Third Reich, the author provides a historical anchor for an otherwise abstract threat, making the "super soldiers" feel less like a modern fantasy and more like the continuation of a documented historical horror.

#### **4. "Sleepers" Have Infiltrated Every Level of Society**

One of the most unsettling strategic elements described is the concept of "placement." The "Chosen Ones" are not held in secret compounds but are deeply embedded within every key institution of society, where they live seemingly normal lives as "sleepers."

The text specifies that these agents have infiltrated **the military, law enforcement, government, and, most surprisingly, local churches.** Many of these sleepers are described as "intact," meaning their primary, public-facing personality has no conscious awareness of the network of programmed sub-personalities hidden within their own mind. These hidden parts lie dormant, waiting for a specific activation code to awaken them and execute their pre-programmed orders.

This point transforms the threat from a distant, abstract conspiracy into an immediate and invisible danger. It suggests that these agents are not an external force to be repelled but a hidden cancer already within the system, potentially located anywhere and in anyone, from a trusted colleague to a friendly neighbor.

#### **5. Their Activation Will Be a Coordinated, Supernatural Event**

The sleeper agents are not activated individually. The plan for "The Black Awakening" hinges on a mass activation event, where every agent is awakened simultaneously. This is accomplished through "triggers" or "codes"—a specific sound, phrase, or signal designed to call forth a specific sub-personality and its mission programming.

The book posits that the final activation will be a singular, powerful trigger broadcast globally. This trigger may not be purely technological, described as everything from specific sounds and electronic "bursts/pulses" to a purely supernatural wave of dark demonic power sent to awaken the entire army at once. This activation is a spiritual event as much as a tactical one, a demonic inversion of a divine call designed to be a planetary shock wave unleashed from hell itself.

The chilling efficiency of this plan lies in its simplicity: a single moment that activates a decentralized, nationwide army, turning thousands of hidden sleepers into active combatants and initiating the coordinated collapse of society.

#### **6. The Final Goal Is a Literal War Against God**

According to the source, engineering a global collapse and establishing a new world order is merely a preliminary step. The true, ultimate objective of the entire luciferian agenda is a prophesied event the author refers to as "R1919."

"R1919" is shorthand for the biblical passage Revelation 19:19. This verse depicts the final, climactic battle of history, where the armies of the world, unified under the leadership of the Antichrist, gather together to physically wage war against Jesus Christ at His second coming. The text for this prophesied confrontation is laid out explicitly:

_“Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against the rider on the horse and his army.” Revelation 19:19_

This final takeaway reframes the entire conspiracy. The conflict does not end with earthly power. It begins in the hidden recesses of the human mind, erupts into physical chaos to seize control of the world, and culminates in a supernatural war for the fate of reality itself. It is the ultimate expression of rebellion, a direct military challenge to the divine.

#### **Conclusion: A World Behind the Veil**

The narrative presented in _The Black Awakening_ is one of a hidden war being waged by a secret army of psychologically fractured soldiers, all orchestrated to achieve an apocalyptic climax. It weaves together threads of trauma-based mind control, deep-state conspiracy, Nazi occultism, and biblical prophecy into a comprehensive and terrifying vision of the modern world.

Ultimately, the power of such a narrative lies in its ability to impose a deliberate, albeit terrifying, order on a world that feels random and senseless. It transforms passive victims of chaos into soldiers in a cosmic war. Whether taken as literal truth or a dark allegory, this account forces a profound question: What if the greatest wars are not fought on battlefields, but in the unseen realms of the human spirit?

## Briefing on The Black Awakening Thesis

### Executive Summary

This document synthesizes the core themes, arguments, and claims presented in Russ Dizdar's "The Black Awakening: Rise of the Satanic Super Soldiers." The central thesis posits the existence of a covert, Luciferian conspiracy poised to destabilize global society through a violent, orchestrated event called "The Black Awakening." This event is designed to collapse the existing world order to facilitate the rise of a New World Order led by a figure identified as the Antichrist, or "Homosatanas."

The primary agents of this chaos are "Chosen Ones"—individuals who, since birth, have been subjected to systematic Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA) and trauma-based mind control, resulting in Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), formerly Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD). This process purposefully creates a system of "sub-personalities" or "alters" within the individual. These alters are then programmed, demonically empowered, and highly trained to function as "satanic super soldiers."

According to the source, millions of these Chosen Ones are embedded as "sleepers" within all sectors of society, including the military, law enforcement, government, and Christian churches, awaiting a trigger for activation. The document frames this entire agenda within a specific interpretation of biblical prophecy, particularly Psalm 2, Matthew 24, 2 Thessalonians 2, and Revelation, arguing that these events are the fulfillment of an ancient satanic plan to make war against God, culminating in the battle of Armageddon (Revelation 19:19). The work asserts that this conspiracy has its modern roots in Nazi occultism and mind-control technology, which were absorbed into U.S. intelligence and military projects after World War II.

### 1. Core Concepts

#### 1.1. The Black Awakening

The "Black Awakening" is the term used in the source for a planned, imminent, and catastrophic global event characterized by widespread chaos, anarchy, and violence. It is described as a "great revolt" or "rebellion" designed to collapse societal infrastructure and national governments, particularly the United States.

- **Objective:** To create a power vacuum and a state of such profound crisis that the world's population will desperately accept a pre-planned "New World Order" as a solution.
- **Nature of the Event:** The narrative depicts a sudden, coordinated eruption of violence.
  - Key infrastructure like electrical grids, communications, and transit systems are targeted.
  - Assassins ("Chosen Ones") simultaneously activate, killing political leaders, law enforcement officials, and pre-identified "resistors."
  - Widespread riots, looting, and civil slaughter ("men slay each other") ensue, fueled by a palpable, malevolent spiritual presence.
  - The chaos is described as an "inverted Pentecost"—a massive outpouring of demonic power that energizes the violence.
- **Quote:** _“They would then replace it with theirs. A new order out of the chaos they arrogantly boasted; satanic phoenix rising.”_

#### 1.2. The Chosen Ones: Satanic Super Soldiers

The primary agents tasked with executing the Black Awakening are referred to as "Chosen Ones." This is their self-ascribed title, indicating they were "chosen by satan" to serve his agenda.

- **Definition:** _“‘Chosen Ones’ are those so named because they are ‘chosen by satan’ to serve him. Chosen ones are those who have come up through old bloodlined satanic (Luciferianism) groups that are committed to a coming new order and supernatural world leader. These are the many victims of satanic ritual abuse and soul ripping mind control.”_
- **Creation:** They are not random individuals but are specifically bred within satanic bloodlines and subjected to intense trauma from infancy to induce Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID/MPD). This "splits" their personality into multiple "alters."
- **Programming and Training:** Each alter is specifically programmed for various tasks, including assassination, espionage, infiltration, and ritual magic. They are described as being enhanced with demonic powers, making them physically faster, stronger, and psychically capable (e.g., remote viewing).
- **Ultimate Purpose:** They believe they are the "troops of the coming antichrist" and their purpose is to unleash the Black Awakening, eliminate resistance, and serve in the Antichrist's global army at the final battle of Armageddon (Revelation 19:19).
- **Numbers and Placement:** The document claims there are millions of Chosen Ones—from 4 to 10 million—placed as "sleepers" throughout every institution globally, waiting for an activation trigger.
- **Quote:** _“WE ARE THE LEGIONS WHO WILL RULE THE EARTH.”_ (Attributed to a demonized sub-personality of a Chosen One).

### 2. The Creation and Nature of the Chosen Ones

The source provides a detailed methodology for how Chosen Ones are created, a process it terms a "transmutation" rather than a disorder. This process is rooted in Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA) and a technology of mind control traced back to Nazi Germany.

#### 2.1. The Creation Process

| Stage                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Preparation & Breeding** | Individuals are selected from specific satanic "bloodlines," believed to carry genetic dispositions or demonic empowerments tracing back to the Nephilim. Conception and birth are accompanied by rituals to infuse the fetus with demonic power.                              |
| **Splitting**              | Through extreme trauma (sexual, physical, emotional), the child's core personality is forced to dissociate or "split," creating new, "raw" blank personalities (alters). This is the foundational step.                                                                        |
| **Bonding**                | The perpetrator/programmer bonds with the new alter, naming it and convincing it that they are its creator and sole source of care. This establishes a foundation of absolute control.                                                                                         |
| **Programming**            | The new alter is systematically programmed with specific thoughts, skills, and missions. This can include programming for sex, assassination, information gathering, or satanic rituals.                                                                                       |
| **Demonization**           | The programmed alter is intentionally infused with demonic spirits to provide supernatural power and abilities. This "charges" the personality and its programming.                                                                                                            |
| **Training**               | Alters are trained to perfect their programmed skills, which can include combat, languages, infiltration techniques, and psychic warfare.                                                                                                                                      |
| **Testing**                | Abilities are tested through contests, assignments, or real-world tasks, often involving harming animals or other people.                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Assignments**            | Once trained, alters are given assignments, such as infiltrating a church or monitoring a target.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Triggering**             | Specific codes, sounds, phrases, or symbols are embedded in the programming. When a handler uses a trigger, the corresponding alter is activated to perform its task, often without the host personality's awareness.                                                          |
| **Suicide Programming**    | A final, critical layer of programming creates an alter whose sole function is to kill the host body if the Chosen One is captured, attempts to reveal secrets, or when their mission is complete. This is intended to be a mass-activation command after the Black Awakening. |

#### 2.2. Types and Functions of Sub-Personalities

The source describes a highly organized internal system of alters, each with a specific role:

- **Satanic Priest/Priestess:** Knows and performs rituals, conjures demons, and understands occult languages.
- **Military/Fighter:** Trained in combat, weapons, and assassination. Often speaks German and espouses Nazi ideology.
- **Sexual Slave:** Programmed for sexual acts, used in rituals or to generate income and compromise targets.
- **Informer/Watcher:** Gathers and reports information on targets, helpers, and handlers. They are co-conscious, observing everything.
- **Enforcer/Punisher:** Maintains internal order by punishing other alters or the host body to ensure compliance with the coven.
- **Runner:** Programmed to physically escape and return the body to the coven/handlers when triggered.
- **Guardian/Protector:** Guards internal secrets and prevents other alters from talking to helpers.
- **Counterfeit Christian:** An alter programmed to mimic Christianity perfectly for the purpose of infiltrating churches.
- **Sleeper:** A deeply hidden, powerfully programmed alter (often an assassin) that awaits the final activation trigger for the Black Awakening.

### 3. The Luciferian Conspiracy

The creation of Chosen Ones is presented not as a series of isolated crimes but as a core component of a vast, ancient, and supernaturally-guided conspiracy.

#### 3.1. The Overarching Agenda: A New World Order

The ultimate goal of the conspiracy is to establish a one-world government, economy, and religion—a "New World Order"—under the direct rule of a Luciferian elite and their leader, the Antichrist.

- **Strategy:** The strategy is "Ordo Ab Chao" (Order Out of Chaos). The Black Awakening is the manufactured chaos intended to make the world beg for the pre-planned new order.
- **Spiritual Foundation:** The ideology is explicitly Luciferian. It posits Lucifer as a being of light and knowledge, offering humanity an "evolution to deification," in direct opposition to the God of the Bible. This is described as the foundational lie from the Garden of Eden.
- **Quote:** _“THERE IS NO GLOBALISM WITHOUT THE SUPERNATURAL SPIRITUAL FORCE BEHIND IT.”_

#### 3.2. Key Actors and Perpetrators

- **The "Illuminati"/Luciferian Elite:** A secret, self-proclaimed elite who believe they possess superior knowledge and are destined to rule. They are described as operating through secret societies and controlling global finance, politics, and media. The **Bohemian Grove** is cited as a key ritual site where world leaders are influenced by summoned demonic powers.
- **The Nazi Regime:** The source identifies the Nazi party as the modern origin point for the technology and ideology behind the Chosen Ones. It claims Nazi occultism, particularly the "Black Flame," was a direct manifestation of this Luciferian agenda. Projects like Lebensborn are seen as early attempts to breed a "master race" of super soldiers.
- **The Military-Occult Complex:** It is asserted that after WWII, Nazi scientists, doctors, and occultists were brought into the U.S. via programs like "Operation Paper Clip," infiltrating the CIA, Department of Defense, and other intelligence agencies. This brought the mind-control technology that became projects like **MK-ULTRA** and **Monarch**, which allegedly continued and expanded the work of creating mind-controlled super soldiers.
- **Generational Covens:** The abuse is often trans-generational, with family members (parents, grandparents) being part of a coven and perpetuating the cycle on their own children, who are then forced to do the same to the next generation.

#### 3.3. Infiltration of Societal Institutions

A key tactic of the conspiracy is the placement of Chosen Ones into every critical societal institution to act as spies, saboteurs, and assassins.

- **Churches:** Described as a primary target. Infiltrators are sent to sow discord, perform rituals, gather information, compromise leaders, and act as "sleepers" who will assassinate pastors and destroy congregations when the Black Awakening begins.
- **Military & Law Enforcement:** Chosen Ones are placed to sabotage command structures, assassinate leaders, and turn units against each other, ensuring that official response to the chaos is crippled.
- **Government & Politics:** Placed to promote the globalist agenda and ensure political collapse at the appointed time.

### 4. Prophetic and Spiritual Framework

The entire thesis is interpreted through the lens of literalist Christian eschatology. The events are not seen as random but as the direct fulfillment of biblical prophecy.

#### 4.1. Key Biblical Prophecies

- **Psalm 2 & Revelation 19:19 (R1919):** This is the central prophetic theme. Psalm 2 is interpreted as a 3,000-year-old prophecy of a final global conspiracy where the "kings of the earth" gather to make war against God and His "Anointed One" (Christ). Revelation 19:19 is seen as its ultimate fulfillment at the Battle of Armageddon, where the Antichrist ("the beast") and his armies gather to fight the descending Christ. The creation of super soldiers is seen as the necessary preparation for this final battle.
- **2 Thessalonians 2:** This passage is cited to predict a "great revolt" or "rebellion" (interpreted as the Black Awakening) that must occur before the "man of lawlessness" (the Antichrist) is revealed. It also speaks of a "secret power of lawlessness" that is "already at work," which is identified as the supernatural secrecy cloaking the entire conspiracy.
- **Matthew 24 & Revelation 6:** Jesus's prophecy of end-times deception, wars, and chaos ("the beginning of birth pains") is cited. The "red horse" of Revelation 6, which "take[s] peace from the earth" and makes "men slay each other," is directly equated with the civil slaughter of the Black Awakening.
- **Matthew 13:** The Parable of the Wheat and the Tares is interpreted as Jesus revealing that Satan ("the evil one") secretly "sows" his own children ("tares") among God's people. The "tares" are equated with the Chosen Ones, created and placed to counter God's work.

#### 4.2. Countermeasures and Spiritual Warfare

The document concludes with a call to action for Christians to engage in aggressive spiritual and physical preparation.

- **Spiritual Countermeasures:**
  - Deep knowledge of biblical prophecy to understand the enemy's "play book."
  - Intense, "fierce" prayer to expose and destroy "cones of power" (ritual sites like Bohemian Grove).
  - Exercising spiritual authority in the name of Jesus Christ to cast out demons from victims.
  - Developing "Holy Spirit Perception" (HSP) for supernatural discernment.
- **Physical Preparation:**
  - Storing food, water, and supplies for a societal collapse.
  - Acquiring weapons and self-defense training to protect families.
  - Making emergency plans and learning survival skills.
  - The ultimate preparation is framed as spiritual readiness: personal salvation through Jesus Christ.

## A Case Study Profile: Trauma-Based Mind Control and the "Chosen One" Phenomenon

### 1.0 Introduction and Scope

This document provides a clinical synthesis and psychological analysis of a specific, self-contained body of text describing a phenomenon referred to as the "Chosen One" program. The purpose of this case study is to objectively document the alleged psychological methodologies, conditioning processes, and ideological frameworks as presented in the source material, for the benefit of professionals in mental health and criminal justice. This analysis is not an endorsement of the material's claims but an objective examination of its contents. All information is strictly derived from the provided context and is presented here for clinical and analytical examination, offering a framework for understanding the psychological architecture of trauma-based coercive control as described within the source text. This section will begin by defining the core terminology used throughout the study.

#### 1.1 Defining Key Terminology

The following terms are central to the source material's narrative and are defined here based exclusively on its descriptions.

- **Chosen Ones** Individuals described as "chosen by satan" who originate from "old bloodlined satanic (Luciferianism) groups." They are reported to be victims of systematic Satanic Ritual Abuse and mind control, which results in the purposeful creation of Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD).
- **Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA)** The alleged methodology involving traumatic rituals, including sexual abuse and the shedding of blood, used as the primary tool to induce dissociation and create Multiple Personality Disorder in targeted individuals.
- **Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD) / Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID)** Described not as a naturally occurring disorder but as the purposeful creation of multiple "sub personalities" or "alters" within a single individual through systematic, trauma-based mind control techniques.
- **The Black Awakening** The term used within the source to describe a planned, global event of chaos, anarchy, and violence. It is allegedly orchestrated to collapse existing societal structures, including governments, economies, and infrastructure, to create a state of helplessness and pave the way for a new world order.

These foundational definitions provide the necessary context for a more detailed examination of the subject profile allegedly produced through these methods.

### 2.0 Subject Profile: The "Chosen One" Archetype

Understanding the composite psychological and behavioral profile of the subject is crucial for analyzing the alleged methodologies of coercive control. This section constructs a profile of a "Chosen One" by synthesizing all descriptive characteristics provided in the source material. This archetype serves as the baseline for examining the psychological manipulation and conditioning techniques reportedly employed to create a functionally specialized, ideologically committed individual.

#### 2.1 Core Attributes and Origins

The "Chosen One" is described as an individual who has been "selected, born and raised" within a highly organized, clandestine system. Their origins are consistently traced to "old bloodlined satanic (Luciferianism) groups" that are multigenerational. They are not random individuals but are products of this system, designated as victims of "satanic ritual abuse and soul ripping mind control." The defining psychological outcome of this upbringing is the induced dissociative fragmentation of their core identity into "many sub personalities," a state the source refers to as Multiple Personality Disorder.

#### 2.2 Programmed Abilities and Disposition

The source material attributes a specific set of abilities and psychological traits to the "Chosen Ones," which are reportedly programmed into their alter personalities. These characteristics appear to be the logical outcomes of the conditioning methodology detailed later in this analysis.

- **Programmed and Demonized Sub-Personalities:** The majority of their internal sub-personalities are reported to be deliberately programmed and "demonized," a process described as enhancing their abilities for assigned tasks.
- **Advanced Training:** These individuals are characterized as "highly trained and constantly maintained." Their various alter personalities are programmed with specialized skills, ranging from combat and espionage to psychological and psychic warfare.
- **Supernatural Powers:** They are reported to possess "many abilities, powers," which they have "hard fought for" and are unwilling to relinquish. These abilities are presented as enhancements derived from their conditioning and alleged supernatural augmentation.
- **Disposition:** In their activated states, their demeanor is characterized as "cold as hell," showing "no mercy," and possessing an "ominous ancient hatred." This disposition is consistent with the psychological numbing resultant from repeated trauma-based splitting and the ideological reinforcement of generational indoctrination. Physical descriptions of this state include "black glassy eyes" and a "contorted menacing face," indicative of a profound dissociative shift.

Understanding this psychological composite is crucial for deconstructing the alleged technology of personality fragmentation and indoctrination reportedly used to engineer such an outcome.

### 3.0 Alleged Methodology of Subject Creation and Conditioning

The source material presents the creation of a "Chosen One" not as the development of a random disorder but as a purported technology of coercive indoctrination and identity fragmentation. This section deconstructs this alleged systematic, multi-stage process, outlining the sequential stages from generational selection to long-term maintenance and control.

#### 3.1 Stage 1: Generational Selection and Preparation

The process allegedly begins before the subject's birth. Selection focuses on specific "bloodlines" and "genetics" believed to carry or be receptive to supernatural power. The source claims that parents are specifically chosen, often with the goal of having parents who already possess "demonic powers." This is reportedly done to create a "supernaturally empowered fetus," predisposing the child to the subsequent stages of conditioning.

#### 3.2 Stage 2: Trauma-Based Splitting

The core mechanism described is a form of iatrogenic dissociative splitting, induced through overwhelming trauma to deliberately fracture the subject's core identity. This intense trauma, often involving ritual abuse, causes the core personality to "split" as a survival mechanism. The result of this induced dissociative fragmentation is a "new raw personality" that is described as "blank and nameless." This newly formed, unprogrammed alter becomes the raw material for the next stage of conditioning.

#### 3.3 Stage 3: Bonding and Programming

Once a new alter is created, a two-part process of coercive persuasion begins to shape it for a specific purpose.

- **Coercive Attachment:** The "splitter/programmer" immediately establishes a bond with the new, disoriented alter. They position themselves as the alter's sole creator, caretaker, and source of identity. This trauma bond is reinforced through rituals, such as being "saved" by the programmer from a staged life-threatening situation (e.g., being left in a coffin or pushed underwater), thereby creating a deep, coercive attachment.
- **Systematic Indoctrination:** This is the process of instilling "thought, content and agenda" into the "blank" alter. Each personality is programmed for a specific, compartmentalized function, such as "sex programming, warrior programming," or assassination. The source mentions the use of Nazi-derived techniques, such as "doubling," to create these functionally distinct personalities.

#### 3.4 Stage 4: Supernatural Augmentation ("Demonization")

A key component of the conditioning is a process the source refers to as "demonization." From a psychological perspective, this is framed as an alleged method of ideological reinforcement and psychological empowerment, wherein the alter is conditioned to attribute its enhanced capabilities to an external, supernatural source. This process of "charging" a sub-personality with "demonic power" reportedly solidifies its loyalty and sense of purpose within the group's esoteric belief system, enhancing its ability to perform its programmed task with supernatural strength. This augmentation is reportedly achieved through rituals, including sex rituals and the conjuring of demonic entities.

#### 3.5 Stage 5: Maintenance and Control

To ensure long-term control over the subject and their system of alters, several mechanisms are allegedly programmed into them.

1. **Programmed Cues and Activation Protocols:** Programmers install specific triggers—words, sounds, symbols, or phrases—that function as programmed cues. These cues can be used by handlers to "call up" a specific sub-personality on command, allowing for the execution of designated tasks without the awareness of the host personality or other alters.
2. **Suicide Programming:** The source alleges the existence of at least one sub-personality programmed with a single function: a self-termination directive to kill the host body if triggered. This protocol is reportedly activated to prevent the subject from revealing secrets, to stop them from leaving the group, or to eliminate them if they are captured by authorities.

This multi-stage methodology allegedly results in a highly complex and compartmentalized internal psychological structure, which is detailed in the next section.

### 4.0 The Resulting Psychological Structure: The System of Alter Personalities

The alleged outcome of this systematic conditioning is not a singular, integrated personality but a complex internal system of distinct alters. According to the source, this is not a chaotic byproduct of abuse but an engineered internal hierarchy designed for operational security and functional specialization, with each alter assigned a compartmentalized role. This section categorizes the primary alter types described in the source material to provide a clinical map of the subject's reported internal architecture.

#### 4.1 Typology of Programmed Alters

The following table synthesizes the descriptions of the various sub-personalities mentioned in the source material, outlining their programmed roles and functions within the internal system. While the functions are described explicitly in the source, some titles (e.g., "Watcher," "Disinformation Agent") are clinical categorizations synthesized from those descriptions for clarity.

| Alter Type/Function      | Description of Programmed Role                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Satanic Priestess**    | Described as arrogant and knowledgeable in rituals, symbols, and conjuring demons. Responsible for carrying out satanic ceremonies.                        |
| **Fighter**              | Programmed for physical combat, knowledgeable in martial arts, and capable of attacking targets without regard to their own physical size.                 |
| **Informer**             | Tasked with reconnaissance; gathers and reports information on targets, helpers, and handlers. Creates "files" on perceived threats.                       |
| **Enforcer/Punisher**    | Responsible for maintaining internal discipline by punishing the host body or other alters to ensure compliance with the coven's agenda.                   |
| **Runner**               | A fast and strong alter programmed to physically transport the host body to a designated location (e.g., a ritual site, a handler meeting) when triggered. |
| **Sex Slave**            | Trained in sexual practices for use in sex rituals, generating revenue, or compromising targets.                                                           |
| **PSI Warrior**          | Trained in psychic abilities such as remote viewing and telekinesis, often with a background in military projects like the "First Earth Battalion."        |
| **Assassin**             | Programmed to kill specific targets on command, particularly during the "Black Awakening" to eliminate perceived resistors.                                |
| **Watcher**              | Assigned to monitor other multiples/chosen ones, especially those seeking to leave the system, and to keep tabs on helpers.                                |
| **Disinformation Agent** | Programmed to mislead helpers, law enforcement, or counselors with false information to protect the coven and its operations.                              |

This compartmentalized internal system is allegedly driven by a unifying ideology and a shared, ultimate purpose, which will be examined next.

### 5.0 Reported Ideology and Stated Purpose

To understand the motivations behind such a complex and destructive system of psychological control, it is essential to analyze the core belief system and ultimate objectives attributed to the "Chosen One" program. This section examines the reported ideology that allegedly motivates both the perpetrators and the programmed alters, framing it not as a statement of fact but as a crucial component of the psychological framework presented in the source material.

#### 5.1 The "Black Awakening": The Catalyst for a New Order

The central short-term objective described in the source is an event termed the "Black Awakening." This is presented as a planned, global-scale operation designed to induce mass chaos, anarchy, and societal breakdown. The explicit goal is to "collapse everything" and "level the whole structure" of modern civilization. The purpose of this manufactured crisis is to create a state of "forced helplessness" on a global scale. Out of this engineered chaos, a "new order" is intended to emerge, presenting itself as the only solution to the devastation it covertly orchestrated.

#### 5.2 The Ultimate Goal: An Army for a New World Leader

The ultimate stated purpose of creating the "Chosen Ones" is to form a dedicated and powerful army for a prophesied world leader. The source reports that they identify themselves as the "troops of the coming antichrist." Their creation is described as part of a long-term, multigenerational plan to build a "highly spiritually charged super military" whose loyalty is singular: to this coming leader. This army is allegedly intended to enforce the new world order and ultimately to "make war against the rider on the horse and his army," an event the source designates as R1919.

To further illustrate these concepts, the following section provides specific case examples as described in the source material.

### 6.0 Case Vignettes from the Source Material

To illustrate the preceding analysis with concrete examples, this section presents brief, synthesized vignettes of specific cases described within the source material. These vignettes serve to ground the theoretical framework of the "Chosen One" profile and methodology in reported real-world behaviors and events.

#### 6.1 Case A: The Infiltrator ("Mary")

Case A illustrates the operational effectiveness of dissociative compartmentalization, allowing a subject to function as a covert infiltrator while the host identity remains unaware of the alter's espionage activities. The source details the case of "Mary," the wife of a federal officer, whose coven-loyal sub-personalities gathered information on helpers to report back to their handlers. These alters executed a "death ritual" against a helper using a stolen photograph. The case concludes with the detail that she returned from a trip to Germany with a picture of a Nazi SS officer, on the back of which were the signed words "the black flame."

#### 6.2 Case B: The Activated Assassin

Case B provides a reported example of the activation of a deeply embedded aggressive alter, demonstrating a profound shift in personality, physical demeanor, and vocal patterns, culminating in the execution of a pre-programmed self-termination directive. The source describes a man captured by police whose eyes became "black glassy" and whose face took on a "weird contorted menacing" expression. A new personality emerged, speaking with a "deep growling German accent" and shouting the declaration: “WE ARE THE LEGIONS WHO WILL RULE THE EARTH.” Immediately following this statement, he seized an officer's weapon and committed suicide, an act presented as energized programming overriding the instinct of self-preservation.

#### 6.3 Case C: The Sleeper Agent Attack

Case C is presented as a quintessential example of a "sleeper" activation, highlighting the potential for latent, highly violent alters to be triggered into action with no warning, followed by the host professing complete amnesia for the event. The author recounts an incident where a woman, initially presenting as a friendly victim of ritual abuse, suddenly attacked him in his office with a bayonet. The attack was unprovoked and accompanied by the emergence of a non-verbal, aggressive personality with eyes described as "black and glazed over." After being subdued, the woman professed total amnesia, illustrating the profound dissociative barriers between alter states.

These vignettes provide practical examples of the behaviors and phenomena analyzed in this study, leading to the final concluding analysis.

### 7.0 Concluding Analysis

This case study has documented the "Chosen One" phenomenon as presented within the provided source text. The analysis reveals a reported methodology that appears to be a systematic, multigenerational process of trauma-based conditioning. This process is designed to create a population of dissociated, functionally compartmentalized, and ideologically loyal agents through induced dissociative fragmentation, systematic indoctrination of the resulting alters, and alleged supernatural augmentation. The resulting psychological structure is a complex internal system of specialized personalities, maintained and controlled through programmed cues and fail-safes such as self-termination protocols. According to the source material, this represents a highly organized and psychologically sophisticated form of coercive control with a clearly defined, revolutionary agenda.

## Glossary of Key Terms

**Alters** : A term for the separate, distinct personalities that exist inside the body of one person who has Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD) or Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID). Each alter has its own feelings, memories, and history.

**Armageddon** : The final battle described in biblical prophecy (Revelation 16 and 19:19) where the antichrist and the gathered armies of the world make war against Jesus Christ at his second coming. It is presented as the ultimate goal of the luciferian agenda.

**Black Awakening** : A future, planned event of massive chaos, anarchy, and violence orchestrated by activated "Chosen Ones." Its purpose is to collapse existing society, government, and infrastructure to pave the way for the rise of the antichrist and a new world order.

**Chosen Ones** : Individuals chosen by satan from Luciferian bloodlines, who have been subjected to Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA) and trauma-based mind control to create multiple personalities (alters). These alters are programmed, demonized, and highly trained to serve as the troops of the coming antichrist.

**Cones of Power** : Locations, also referred to as "high places," where powerful dark rituals and blood sacrifices are performed. These sites, such as the Bohemian Grove, are believed to create gateways or "thrones" for satan, from which demonic powers can be summoned and sent out to influence world leaders and events.

**DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder)** : The clinical term for what was formerly known as Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD). It refers to the condition where trauma causes a person's identity to fragment into two or more distinct personality states.

**Doubling** : The ability, described in relation to Nazi doctors and luciferian perpetrators, to live two separate and distinct lives. An individual can present a normal, public persona while simultaneously engaging in horrific, evil acts in secrecy without apparent internal conflict.

**Homosatanas** : A term for the antichrist, signifying a counterfeit incarnation of satan in human flesh. This being is described as the most supernaturally charged person outside of Jesus Christ, animated with the living presence of satan.

**Illuminati / The Illumined** : The secret elite who believe they possess superior spiritual knowledge and are destined to rule the world. They are the masterminds behind the globalist agenda, the creation of the Chosen Ones, and the push for a new world order out of chaos.

**Luciferian** : An individual or group that knowingly serves Lucifer (satan), believing him to be a "bright light" bringing illumination. They are committed to the core luciferian doctrine of spiritual evolution towards godhood and the political agenda of a new world order.

**MPD (Multiple Personality Disorder)** : The former clinical term for Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), referring to the existence of one or more distinct alter personalities within an individual as a result of severe trauma.

**New Age Movement (NAM)** : Described as the largest and fastest-growing occult spiritual movement in history. It promotes an alternative spirituality, an alternative christ, and a one-world system, which the author contends is a "lethal" deception that serves as a primary vehicle for the "seducing spirits" prophesied to come in the last days.

**Planetary Defense Weapons (PDWs)** : Advanced military weapon systems being developed, ostensibly to defend Earth from an extraterrestrial threat. The author posits that their true purpose is to be used at Armageddon in the attempt to fight the descending army of Jesus Christ.

**Prophetic Revelation (PR)** : The body of prophecy within the Bible, which the author asserts is the only infallible source of information on the past, present, and future. It is presented as God's "heads up" that reveals the "sequence of the satanic agenda" from beginning to end.

**R1919** : The author's shorthand for the biblical prophecy in Revelation 19:19, which details the final gathering of the world's armies under the antichrist to make war on Christ. It is cited repeatedly as the ultimate satanic endgame.

**Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA)** : The systematic physical, sexual, mental, emotional, and spiritual abuse of individuals, particularly children, within the context of satanic rituals. This abuse is used to traumatize victims to the point of splitting their personalities for the purpose of mind control.

**Splitting** : The foundational act in creating a multiple personality. It occurs when a victim is subjected to such massive trauma that their core personality dissociates and "snaps" or breaks, resulting in the emergence of a new, blank "raw" alter personality that can then be programmed.

**Sub-personality** : A personality that was split off from the core and created to exist as a secondary, hidden personality within a multiple. Chosen Ones contain many sub-personalities, each programmed for a specific task or ability (e.g., fighter, informer, runner, priestess).

**Tares** : A biblical term from a parable told by Jesus (Matthew 13), interpreted by the author to mean the "sons of the evil one." These are the servant soldiers (Chosen Ones) created and "sown" into the world by the devil to grow alongside and counter the people of God.

**Triggers** : Words, sounds, symbols, or phrases used as codes to activate a specific sub-personality and compel it to perform its programmed function. Triggers allow handlers to control a Chosen One remotely without the host personality's knowledge.
