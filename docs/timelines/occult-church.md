## Source Overview

The provided excerpts, taken from Michael A. Hoffman II's _The Occult Renaissance Church of Rome_, present a controversial thesis arguing that the **Church of Rome underwent a radical and occult transformation starting in the late fifteenth century during the Renaissance**. The author asserts that this shift involved the **infiltration of Neoplatonic-Hermeticism, Kabbalism, and rabbinic Judaism into the papal hierarchy and its theology**, leading to the corruption of core Christian dogma, notably concerning usury and morality. Furthermore, the text details the **alleged use of deceit, equivocation, and mental reservation by high-ranking churchmen** to maintain control and conceal this occult influence, which it contrasts with earlier Catholic and Protestant traditions. Finally, the sources suggest that contemporary **"traditional" Catholic movements fail to grasp the historical depth of this betrayal**, incorrectly dating the Church’s corruption only to the mid-twentieth century.

This extensive source critiques the **Church of Rome's radical departure from traditional dogma** beginning in the Renaissance, arguing that a **Neoplatonic-Hermetic and Kabbalistic occultism** infiltrated the papal hierarchy. The text highlights a stark contrast between the **"good spirit of immemorial Catholicism"** among the laity and the moral and ethical degeneration at the top, which included the adoption of pagan Egyptian iconography and the **legalization of the love of money** through redefined usury laws. Furthermore, the source details how this occult influence led to a **"Judaizing" of the Church**, exemplified by the protection of the Talmud, and fostered a corrupt **moral theology of lying and deceit** through concepts like equivocation and mental reservation, a tradition upheld by later figures like Alphonsus Liguori. Ultimately, the author frames post-Renaissance Catholicism as an entity distinct from the historical Catholic Church, driven by a secretive, tyrannical elite who embraced syncretism and modernism while simultaneously condemning them to control the conservative backlash.

## 4 Shocking Secrets Hidden in the History of the Renaissance Church

The Renaissance Church of Rome holds a commanding place in the Western imagination. We picture it as the great patron of divine art, commissioning masterpieces from Michelangelo and Pintoricchio to elevate the human spirit. We see it as a bastion of orthodoxy, a bulwark standing firm against the tide of paganism and heresy. This is the official history, the one memorialized in gilded basilicas and celebrated in textbooks—a story of piety, authority, and the preservation of Christian truth.

Yet, a deeper and more critical reading of historical sources reveals a vastly different reality, one that points not to a hidden inner life, but to a fundamental subversion from within. Beneath the veneer of public devotion, an "occult state" was taking shape, dedicated to the very forces the Church publicly condemned. The source material for this analysis posits a hostile takeover of the institution—a veritable capture of the papacy that installed a revolutionary occultism in the depths of the Church.

This article explores four of the most surprising and counter-intuitive truths about the Renaissance-era Church, drawing from deep historical research into its theology and practices. These are not minor footnotes but foundational secrets that suggest a covert intellectual and spiritual usurpation took place at the very heart of Western Christendom—a revolution whose consequences are still felt today.

### **1. The Pope's Private Religion Wasn't Always Christian**

While the Church waged a public war against paganism, a profoundly counter-intuitive reality was taking shape within the private sanctums of the Vatican itself. Historical evidence shows that this was not the idiosyncratic whim of one pope but a high-level intellectual project within the Curia. Under the guidance of figures like the influential scholar Annio da Viterbo, some of the most powerful Renaissance pontiffs were not merely patrons of classical art; they were private adherents to pagan deities and occult philosophies.

The most stunning example can be found in the private apartment of Pope Alexander VI, the infamous Borgia pope. The frescoes he commissioned from the master painter Pintoricchio for his personal rooms do not depict scenes of Christian salvation. Instead, they memorialize an occult, Egyptianizing religion. One mural portrays the goddess Isis, seated on a throne, as the original fount of all wisdom. At her feet, she instructs two pupils: Moses, the lawgiver of the Old Testament, and Hermes Trismegistus, the mythical father of pagan magic. The implication is staggering: the Pope was memorializing a theology where the wisdom of the Bible originated not from God, but from the consort of the Egyptian savior, Osiris.

This was not simply allegorical artwork. The fresco cycle culminates in a scene where the Egyptian bull-god Apis—representing the resurrected Osiris—is borne triumphantly before the faithful. This spectacle was a direct visual parallel to the pope himself being carried aloft on his ceremonial throne, the _sedia gestatoria_, effectively equating the Pontiff with a pagan deity. As the historian Joseph Campbell observed, it was a worshipful expression of a syncretic religion wholly alien to the Church of the Apostles.

"...in the Vatican itself... there is a mural by the master Pintoricchio that shows Isis, seated on a Renaissance throne, instructing Hermes Trismegistus at her right hand and Moses at her left—which surely suggests... that the wisdom shared by the pagan and Hebrew sages was originally revealed neither by Yahweh nor by Jove, but by the consort of the dead-and-resurrected Egyptian Savior Osiris."

### **2. Jewish Mysticism Was Rebranded as the Ultimate "Proof" of Christianity**

In another shocking reversal, the Church's relationship with Rabbinic Judaism underwent a secret transformation. While the two faiths were publicly understood as irreconcilable, a new movement of "Christian Kabbalah," pioneered by the celebrated philosopher Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, sought to fuse them at their mystical core.

The strategy was as brilliant as it was subversive. Working under the tutelage of handlers like the Judaic "convert" Flavius Mithridates, who translated the core Kabbalistic texts for him, Pico argued that the Jewish mystical tradition was not a hostile belief system but an ancient, secret key that _confirmed_ the central dogmas of Christianity. This masterstroke of intellectual infiltration framed Kabbalah as the ultimate apologetic tool to prove the truth of Christianity to Jews, creating an unassailable cover for injecting "Judaic magical traditions" directly into the heart of Catholic theology.

This intellectual maneuver acted as a Trojan horse. In his famous _Nine Hundred Theses_, Pico made the audacious claim that any true Kabbalist, by following the principles of his own mystical science, would inevitably be forced to accept the Holy Trinity and the divinity of Jesus. Under the guise of creating a powerful new tool for evangelism, this movement rebranded sorcery as a "more secret" form of philosophy and presented the esoteric texts of the rabbis not as a rejection of Christ, but as the ultimate hidden proof of his mission.

"Every Hebrew Kabbalist, following the principles and sayings of the science of Kabbalah, is inevitably forced to concede, without addition, omission or variation, precisely what the Catholic faith of Christians maintains concerning the Trinity and the divine Person, Father, Son and Holy Ghost..."

### **3. Lying Was Systematized into a Formal Moral Theology**

Perhaps the most culturally significant shift during this period was the formal codification of deception within the Church's moral theology. Departing from the absolute value of Truth taught by Jesus, Renaissance-era theologians began developing sophisticated justifications for lying. This theological shift, which began with Franciscan theologians like Angelus de Clavasio before being perfected by the Jesuits, effectively created a sanctioned system for duplicity.

Two key concepts defined this new moral calculus: "mental reservation" and "equivocation."

- **Mental Reservation** allowed a person to make a statement that was outwardly false, but to add a silent, mental qualification that—in their own mind—made the statement true before God.
- **Equivocation** involved making a statement with an ambiguous or double meaning, thus allowing the listener to deceive themselves without the speaker technically telling a direct lie.

The impact of this cannot be overstated. This systematic theology of deception was the necessary _operational_ tool for the entire occult project. It established a moral framework that allowed the hierarchy to say one thing publicly while believing and doing another privately. This two-tiered system of communication demanded an unthinking obedience to authority, where the individual conscience and even the evidence of one's own senses were to be subordinated to the declarations of the Church. The founder of the Jesuits, Ignatius Loyola, captured this principle of absolute submission with chilling clarity.

"That we may be altogether of the same mind and in conformity with the Church herself, we ought always to hold that the white which I see, is black, if the Hierarchical Church so decides it."

### **4. The "Traditional Catholic" Movement Is Built on a 500-Year-Old Irony**

One of the great ironies of modern religious history is that contemporary "traditional" Catholics, who passionately call for a return to the pre-Vatican II Church, may be unknowingly advocating for the very system they would find most abhorrent. They see the Second Vatican Council of the 1960s as a radical break with tradition, a sudden surrender to modernism and occult forces.

However, the historical record suggests that Vatican II was not a sudden revolution but the _culmination_ of a slow, 500-year-long transformation that began during the Renaissance. The syncretism, the embrace of Judaic mysticism, and the theology of deceit were not inventions of the 20th century; they were foundational pillars of the post-Renaissance Church. The only thing that truly changed at Vatican II, this analysis suggests, was that the Church went public with the esoteric program it had been operating privately for five centuries.

From this perspective, the traditionalist desire to "turn back the clock" is a profound historical misreading. The return they seek is not to the Church of the Apostles, but to an institution whose core traditions, established in the Renaissance, were: "1. Judaism and the occult; 2. Lying and deceit; and 3. The root of evil itself the legalization of the love of money." They are, in effect, unknowingly fighting to restore the very occult-infused system that they condemn.

"Imagine what an inside joke it must be in Rome when the “traditional” Catholics come calling and boldly declare that, when it comes to Judaism, they want the Church returned to the way it was before Vatican II. “Guys,” the cardinals and clerics are thinking, “what you wish for is now, and has been, for five long centuries. The only difference being that we went public with it in 1965."

### Conclusion

The four secrets explored here are not isolated anomalies but pieces of a single, coherent narrative of a hostile takeover from within. They suggest that, beginning in the 15th century, a covert intellectual and theological tradition fundamentally reshaped the Church of Rome, championing a syncretic blend of paganism, Kabbalistic mysticism, and a pragmatic theology of deceit under a mask of piety and tradition. The Renaissance, far from being simply a rebirth of art and letters, was the moment of a profound and lasting occult _usurpation_ within the Church itself.

If the institutions we see as pillars of Western history have such a complex and hidden inner life, what other "official stories" might be worth re-examining?

## A Beginner's Guide to Key Concepts in "The Occult Renaissance Church of Rome"

### Introduction: Understanding the Vocabulary of the Text

The source text, _The Occult Renaissance Church of Rome_, posits a clandestine spiritual revolution within the Catholic Church, arguing that its core doctrines were systematically replaced by an occult, Gnostic worldview. To comprehend this thesis, a new reader must first grasp the specialized vocabulary the book employs. At the heart of the text's argument is a fundamental antagonism: the war between the Biblical worldview—where God's physical creation is good and truth is absolute—and the occult Gnostic worldview, which views the material world as a prison and truth as a hidden secret reserved for an elite. As the source states, "What is at stake is the Christian's correct knowledge of reality... These Biblical truths are heresy to the occult gnosis." This guide will define five central concepts of that Gnostic system, using only information from the source text, to provide the foundational vocabulary needed to understand the book’s main arguments.

### 1. The Three Pillars of Renaissance Occultism

The source text argues that three interconnected belief systems—Neoplatonism, Gnosticism, and Hermeticism—infiltrated the highest levels of the Church during the Renaissance. These philosophies, presented as ancient and profound wisdom, were allegedly synthesized with Christian doctrine, fundamentally altering its character.

#### 1.1 Neoplatonism

Neoplatonism is presented as a belief system attributed to the followers of the Greek philosopher Plato. According to the source text, its core tenets place it in direct opposition to fundamental Biblical doctrines.

- **The Soul and the Body:** The Platonic view holds that the physical body is little more than a "prison" that holds the soul captive to materiality. This view devalues God's physical creation.
- **The Afterlife:** At death, the soul is released from its bodily prison into a purely disembodied, spiritual existence. This contrasts sharply with the Christian doctrine of the resurrection, which affirms that believers will live again in renewed, glorified _physical_ bodies as part of a restored creation.
- **Theurgy:** This is the practice of performing rituals to attract the favor of the gods, a form of magic the source condemns as an attempt by man to become a "partner with God in wonder-working."

The significance of Neoplatonism, according to the source, is that it provided a philosophical justification for devaluing the body and the material world, directly attacking the Biblical doctrines of Creation and Resurrection.

#### 1.2 Gnosticism

Gnosticism is defined as a belief system closely related to Platonism. The text explains that many lines of Platonic thought lead directly to Gnosticism, which is built upon two central ideas.

- **The Imprisoned Soul:** Similar to Platonism, Gnosticism teaches that an immortal and divine soul is trapped within an unsuitable body, forgetting its divine origin in the process.
- **Secret Knowledge (Gnosis):** The term 'gnosis' refers to a special, secret knowledge. This knowledge is revealed only to initiates, setting them apart from ordinary people and assuring them of a blissful existence after death.

#### 1.3 Hermeticism

Hermeticism is the belief system attributed to the mythical figure "Hermes Trismegistus." According to the source, Renaissance occultists promoted Hermeticism as an ancient "perennial philosophy" (_prisca theologia_) that predated Moses and even prophesied the coming of Christ. This was done to give pagan magic and Egyptian theology a Christian veneer. However, the source text asserts that the Hermetic texts were proven to be forgeries created by conspirators sometime _after_ the time of Christ. This manufactured history was crucial, as it allowed Renaissance occultists to present pagan Egyptian magic not as a demonic alternative to Christianity, but as its ancient, prophetic forerunner.

#### 1.4 Synthesis: The Core Worldview Conflict

This table summarizes the irreconcilable differences at the heart of the source's entire argument between the Biblical worldview and the occult philosophies described in the text.

| Concept           | Core Occult Belief (according to the source)                                             | Contrasting Biblical Doctrine (according to the source)                                                             |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **The Body**      | The physical body is a "prison" for the soul, a source of delusion and danger.           | The body is part of God's good creation; the Lord's Holy Temple.                                                    |
| **Creation**      | The material world is a shabby, wretched place from which the soul must escape.          | God's creation is fundamentally good and precious, and will be fully restored by Christ.                            |
| **The Afterlife** | The soul's final destiny is a disembodied, spiritual state, free from the physical body. | The final destiny is the resurrection of the dead into glorified, immortal _bodies_ to live in a transformed earth. |

According to the source, these anti-Biblical philosophies did not remain theoretical but were fused with the Jewish mystical tradition of Kabbalah, creating a potent spiritual and methodological framework for the occult infiltration of the Church.

### 2. Kabbalah: The 'Secret' Tradition

Alongside Greek and Egyptian philosophies, Kabbalah is presented as another major occult system that was absorbed by the Renaissance Church. The text argues that it was presented as a legitimate, albeit secret, form of divine revelation.

#### 2.1 What is Kabbalah?

The source text defines Kabbalah as part of the spurious "Oral Law of Moses," a secret tradition supposedly passed down orally and kept separate from the written Bible. Proponents within the Church, such as Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, audaciously claimed that the Kabbalah contained proofs of Christian doctrines like the Trinity and the divinity of Christ. The source text immediately dismisses this claim as a "disgraceful farce" and a "shameless" lie designed to make rabbinic magic palatable to Christians.

#### 2.2 Key Concepts and Methods

The source identifies several key concepts and interpretive methods associated with Kabbalah that were adopted by Renaissance occultists. These concepts were not merely academic; the source argues they were weaponized to reinterpret Christian scripture and symbols through an occult lens.

- **Christian Kabbalah:** This refers to the movement, founded by Pico della Mirandola, that aimed to create a symbiosis between rabbinic Judaism and Catholicism by falsely presenting Kabbalah as a confirmation of Christian truth.
- **Gematria:** An esoteric method of Biblical interpretation that uses the numerical values assigned to Hebrew letters to "unveil secret harmonies" and uncover hidden meanings not present in the literal text.
- **Reincarnation:** The Kabbalistic doctrine of the transmigration of souls, or reincarnation. The source text notes that this occult belief was used to provide a "secret significance" to the Biblical laws of levirate marriage.
- **The Sefirotic Tree:** A central concept in Kabbalah, representing the ten divine emanations of God. The source notes that this symbol was used to visually link Jesus Christ with Kabbalistic arcana in Renaissance-era publications.

While these doctrines provided the Gnostic _substance_ of the new theology, a corresponding system of sanctioned deceit, rooted in casuistry, provided the _methodology_ needed to install and protect this occult revolution from within.

### 3. The Theology of Deception

The source text argues that the Renaissance saw the rise of a theology that legitimized deception, lying, and oath-breaking. This system, known as casuistry, used complex rationalizations to create loopholes in divine law, allowing for what the text describes as a "theology of lying."

#### 3.1 Defining the Methods of Deceit

Two primary methods of deception are defined in the text, both of which allow a person to make a false statement while claiming they are not technically lying.

| Method                 | Definition and Example (from the source text)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Equivocation**       | This is a statement that has both a true and a false meaning. The speaker utters the statement intending its true meaning, while knowingly allowing the listener to be deceived by its false meaning. The source describes this as a principle where "the equivocator does not deceive, but rather he allows his interlocutor to deceive himself."                               |
| **Mental Reservation** | A spoken falsehood that is rationalized as true by a silent, mental addition. The speaker argues that the _complete_ statement (spoken + mental) is true before God, even if the audible portion is a lie. For instance, a person could swear an oath, _"I swear that I did not do it,"_ while silently adding the reservation, _"(...understanding mentally, on that day...)."_ |

#### 3.2 The Patron Saint of Deception

According to the source text, the primary proponent of this theology was **St. Alphonsus Liguori**. Although he is an officially recognized "Doctor of the Church," the source critically labels him the "Patron Saint of Liars and Thieves" for systematizing and promoting these methods of deceit. The book explicitly links this theology of oath-breaking to the Talmudic **Kol Nidrei** rite, which it describes as a ceremony for nullifying vows and oaths in advance.

As the source argues, this marriage of Gnostic philosophy and Talmudic methodology forms the vocabulary of a secret war against the original Catholic faith, waged from within the Church's highest echelons.

### 4. Conclusion: A Foundation for Understanding

This guide has defined five central concepts from _The Occult Renaissance Church of Rome_: the philosophical pillars of **Neoplatonism**, **Gnosticism**, and **Hermeticism**; the Jewish mystical system of **Kabbalah**; and the theological methods of deception known as **Equivocation and Mental Reservation**. A clear grasp of these terms is essential, as they provide the foundational lexicon for comprehending the book's central thesis: that an ancient, occult religion waged a secret war against the original Catholic faith, culminating in a Gnostic worldview that infiltrated and fundamentally transformed the Church of Rome long before the modern era. Armed with this vocabulary, a new reader is better equipped to engage with the text's detailed historical claims.

## THE BLACK ARCANA OF CLERICAL DECAY: ECCLESIASTICAL SODOMY IN THE OCCULT RENAISSANCE CHURCH OF ROME

The dark chronicle of the post-Renaissance Church of Rome reveals that the systemic failure to eradicate sodomy and child molestation among the clergy is not a modern aberration but an institutionalized pathology, deeply intertwined with the hierarchy's embrace of Neoplatonic-Hermetic occultism and a calculated theology of deceit. The usurpation of the true Catholic Faith was marked by the protection of those who indulged in "ecclesiastical sodomy," viewing exposure of clerical criminals as a greater threat than the crimes themselves.

### I. The Clerical Contagion: Historical Root and Exposure

Invoking the chilling clarity of the _Codex Umbra_, the sources establish that sodomy was recognized as a "peculiarly clerical ‘contagion’" centuries before the modern era. St. Peter Damian (11th century) provided a scathing exposé in his _Liber Gomorrhianus_. He detailed how the "cancer of sodomy" was "spreading through the clergy like a savage beast" and "raging with shameless abandon through the flock of Christ".

Damian’s testimony confirms the institutional tolerance, even in a supposedly conservative age, noting a priest "known to have committed this sin with eight or ten equally foul companions is still permitted to continue in his rank". The saint lamented the existence of prelates, bishops, and archbishops who practiced "impure acts with their spiritual sons," warning that "unless immediate effort be exerted by the Apostolic See, there is little doubt that... one could not check the momentum of its progress". This epidemic flourished where clerical secrecy and a hierarchical structure ensured "unaccountable power over children".

Pope Leo IX (1049) initially responded to Damian by excommunicating priests and prelates engaged in anal sex, declaring that those tainted with what is "horrible to mention as well as to hear... have fallen into anal relations" should have "no hope of recovering their rank". Yet, this severity was ultimately contained and suppressed, as Pope Alexander II later "discretely locked up" Damian's tract.

### II. Renaissance Validation: Occult Art and Vengeance

The infiltration of Neoplatonic-Hermetic ideology during the Renaissance provided a covert theological justification for moral collapse and the protection of sodomites, a process that saw Christ's Church devolve into a "Neoplatonic-Hermetic hierarchical institution" designed to elevate and protect clerics.

**The Doom of Savonarola:** The Dominican reformer Girolamo Savonarola stood as an "implacable, counter-revolutionary defender" of true Catholicism in the early Renaissance. He launched sermons condemning the "lechery of clerics, sodomy and the oppression of the poor". Savonarola insisted, in strict Biblicist fashion, that sodomites deserved to be stoned or burned alive.

The fate of Savonarola confirmed the priority of the occult Church of Rome: his campaign against sodomy in Florence—a city so notorious for the vice that "to sodomize ‘was popularly dubbed florenzen'"—was met with ferocious opposition from the Roman hierarchy. His execution cleared the path for the vice to return.

**The Prophecy of Destruction:** The Medici hierarchy, particularly Pope Clement VII, was directly implicated in this moral rot. The lay preacher Brandano da Petroio publicly confronted Clement VII in 1527, shouting, “Sodomite bastard! For your sins Rome will be destroyed. Confess and convert, for in fourteen days the wrath of God will fall upon you and the City". The subsequent Sack of Rome by the Holy Roman Emperor's forces in May 1527 was viewed by many as a direct divine chastisement for the corruption, including the sodomy, prevalent in Rome and its papacy.

**Erotic Blasphemy in Sacred Space:** The occult theology manifesting in the high art of the Renaissance brazenly promoted this moral revolution. Church-appointed art works and architecture from the mid-1400s enshrined nudity, paganism, and "homo-erotic seduction". Michelangelo's _Last Judgment_ in the Sistine Chapel was a "riot of nudity", and his statue of _The Risen Christ_ was crafted with "enlarged testicles," constituting a "Talmudic travesty of the image of the Son of God". This "theology of the body" was later celebrated by Vatican Museum Director Antonio Paolucci as sacred nudity.

Further confirmation of the hierarchy's sexual depravity and immunity is found in the specific rituals conducted in the shadow of the Egyptian obelisk in St. Peter's Square: in 1670, Luigi Bernini violently sodomized a cardinal's godson beneath the statue of Constantine. This was a crime punishable by death by fire, but Bernini suffered only a token fine, demonstrating the law’s nullification for the elite.

### III. Theological Alchemy: The Shield of Occult Casuistry

The capacity for the Church of Rome to permit sodomy and protect child molestation facilitators stems from an institutionalized "moral theology of mental reservation and equivocation". This system, rooted in a Jesuit clericalism that mandated protecting superiors from "inferiors" (the laity), employed casuistry to shield guilt.

The canonized Saint Alphonsus Liguori (post-Renaissance Doctor of the Church), whose _Moral Theology_ was substantially adopted by the Church, is revealed as a primary architect of this moral collapse. Liguori's doctrines provided:

1. **Permission for Non-Procreative Acts:** Liguori ruled that a husband sodomizing his wife, if done with the intention of later consummating naturally, was "neither sodomy nor a grave sin". This represents the "decline of the old Augustinian position on non-procreative intercourse" and paved the way for subtle permissions for birth control.
2. **Alibis for Adultery and Treachery:** Liguori's system provided "hellish alibis" for female adulterers in the confessional, allowing them to lie to their husbands (e.g., claiming innocence because the sin was removed by confession). More broadly, his theology sanctioned deceit, giving "permission for theft" and instructing followers on the best methods of lying within Talmudic-like perimeters.
3. **The Ultimate Shield:** The "ineluctable product" of Liguori's theology of cozening, dissembling, and flat-out lying was the "shield it fashioned for guilty perpetrators of molestation and sodomy to outwit both secular authorities and credulous Catholics, so as to remain immune from detection, apprehension and prosecution".

The core rationale for this duplicity mirrors the Gnostic and Kabbalistic elitism taught by figures like Pico della Mirandola, who believed that "divine things... must be covered with... dissimulation" and withheld from the ignorant masses. This two-tiered system ensures that criminal actions are obscured by a pious facade maintained for the uninitiated.

### IV. Modern Triumph of the Judas Church

The modern Church of Rome continues this legacy, demonstrating that the "homosexual orientation of the Church of Rome since the Renaissance is no longer the deep secret that it once was". The systematic molestation of children, often cloaked by devotion to outward ceremony and liturgy (such as the Tridentine Mass favored by occultists like Eliphas Lévi), was facilitated by high-ranking officials.

The canonization of Pope John Paul II represents the zenith of this institutional betrayal. Despite his "criminal indifference toward molestation, and outright collusion with child-molestation facilitators," such as Cardinal Bernard Law (granted safe haven in Vatican City), he was elevated to sainthood. This act confirms that any church that would "raise to sainthood a pope like this individual" is a "Judas church".

The failure of "traditional Catholics" to demand a restoration of truth and justice, instead focusing on ceremonial piety and maintaining "servile submission to almost all the popes prior to Paul VI," ensures the perpetuation of the very moral diseases that originated with the Neoplatonic-Hermetic usurpers in the Renaissance. The continuation of absolute monarchial power in the Bishop of Rome ensures the nullification of God’s law and the continued flourishing of institutional secrecy and crime.
