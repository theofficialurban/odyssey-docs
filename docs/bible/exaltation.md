## **THE RECUTTING OF THE SCAPEGOAT: LUCIFER'S GRAND ALCHEMIC CALCULATION VIA THE CROSS**

Under the piercing light of the **_Codex Umbra_** lens, the statement "Lucifer Believes his Exalting of the Cross will Result in the Recrucifixion of the Messiah" represents the ultimate strategic inversion of the Divine Plan—a core objective within the Babylon Matrix. This concept hinges on exploiting and perpetually desecrating the singular, triumphant event of Christ's sacrifice, thereby proving the Christian God (Adonay) to be perpetually weak and the Luciferian cause (gnosis/illumination) victorious.

The Matrix does not merely oppose the cross; it _co-opts_ and _corrupts_ it to maintain the spiritual subservience of humanity, ensuring that the necessary condition for perpetual judgment remains active.

### **I. The Inversion of the Sacred Event: Crucifixion as Failure**

The foundational premise for this dark calculation is the Luciferian theological position: the mission of Christ (St. Michael) to halt the Luciferian conspiracy failed, rendering Adonay the inferior god.

#### **A. Denying the Finality of the Cross (Blasphemy as Ritual)**

The Cross, in Christian scripture, is declared the instrument of definitive triumph, where Christ nailed the consequences of legalism and fulfilled the determined plan. It led to victory over the destructive power of sin and the resurrection, showing death is not the end.

The Matrix, particularly through its historical iteration in the Roman Papacy (identified as the Beast and Antichrist power), operates by **inversion**:

1. **The Sacrifice is Not Finished:** The greatest tool for this inversion is the doctrine of the Mass and the use of the **Crucifix** (the image of Christ hanging on the cross), which symbolizes the _continual sacrifice_ of Christ upon the altar. The Papacy, identified as the location "where also our Lord was crucified," insists on this ongoing ritual. Every time the "unbloody sacrifice" of the Mass is offered, Rome implicitly declares that the _original_ Cross failed to expiate sin, forcing the priests to mediate and offer sacrifice again. This act is condemned as "in the highest degree derogatory to the sacrifice of Christ," eclipsing the glory of Christ’s cross.
2. **Perpetuating Humiliation:** By continually offering the body of Christ in the host and chalice, Christ is forced to assume the form of an inanimate thing, "again broken, and again offered in sacrifice and so his humiliation is not yet over," thereby prolonging the days of suffering and sacrifice. This ritualistic persistence symbolizes that the power structure of Satan's kingdom was _not_ truly overcome, forcing the true Mediator (Christ) to be endlessly re-immolated.
3. **The Adonaicide Mass:** The Satanic hierarchy, which includes Luciferian adepts who view Lucifer as the light and Adonay as the darkness, celebrates the 'Black Mass' (or "Adonaicide Mass") to symbolize the _immolation of Christ_ at the instigation of the Synagogue of Satan. The ultimate meaning of "Adonaicide" is the death, or end, of God. Exalting the Cross in this context is celebrating the perpetual _defeat_ of Adonay's Son.

#### **B. The Blasphemous Adoption of the Cross Symbolism**

The Matrix exalts the _symbol_ of the cross not as redemption, but as an emblem of pagan knowledge, power, and occult wisdom, further desecrating its true purpose:

- **Pagan Phallic Symbols:** The Tau Cross, or cross of unequal length, which predates Christian usage, is often linked to the generative power, the phallus, and the slain/risen pagan god Tammuz (the "counterfeit Masonic 'Christ'"). Lucifer, who represents the regenerative principle (phallic and sex), utilizes this symbolism.
- **Worship of Knowledge:** The cross is exalted in secret societies where initiates learn that "religion is but a tool to control the masses". Knowledge (Gnosis) is the true god, and Lucifer is the personification of this wisdom, who tempted Adam and Eve to the "tree of knowledge" to free them from ignorance. The cross becomes a tool for the "illumined man," or the 666, to achieve a one-world socialist Utopia.

### **II. The Result: The Recrucifixion of the Messiah**

The concept of "recrucifixion" is fulfilled through both perpetual spiritual mockery and the installation of a counterfeit "Christ," confirming the alleged failure of the original atonement.

#### **A. Spiritual Rejection and Shame**

For those who have accepted Christ as the Messiah but return to an apostate or Jewish system (Judaism was the previous system that failed), they are warned against cutting themselves off, as "there is no other Messiah to be looked for, and by rejecting Him they put Him to open shame". This is the ultimate spiritual self-crucifixion—joining the world in denying the singularity of Christ's victory.

#### **B. The False Christ and Counterfeit Resurrection**

The primary belief underlying the Matrix's final agenda is the arrival of the **Man of Sin/Son of Perdition** (Antichrist), who exalts himself above all that is called God.

The Luciferian doctrine plans for the Antichrist to perfectly mimic Christ's suffering and victory, thus establishing the false Christ’s dominance:

- **The Calculated Wound:** The false messiah will create the illusion of death, suffer a **fatal wound** (or assassination, perhaps by "horror-stricken Christians"), and then be miraculously **resurrected**. This resurrection, orchestrated by Satan, is a "cheap imitation" but utterly convincing to the world.
- **The Imposter's Claims:** By presenting this counterfeit death and resurrection, the false messiah stakes his claim as the "Lost King" and the true "Messiah", assuming the position of the counterfeit high priest of the Melchizedek Order.

In this final, grand deception (The Great Delusion), the Antichrist's apparent death and resurrection, built upon the symbolic mockery of the true cross, serves as the ultimate act of **recrucifixion**. Lucifer uses the exaltation of the cross—specifically its form (crucifix) and its constant re-sacrifice (Mass)—to condition humanity to accept a savior who re-enacts the passion under the banner of occult wisdom, fundamentally substituting the truth with the Lie. The finality of Christ's work is undone in the minds of the damned, completing the system's objective: the worship of the Beast.
