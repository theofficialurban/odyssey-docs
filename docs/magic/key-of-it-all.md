Ultimately, the work aims to be the definitive reference for understanding the numerical dimensions and **secret correspondences** underlying sacred words and mystical practices across diverse cultures.

## A Comprehensive Reference Manual of Sacred Languages and Magickal Systems

### 1.0 Introduction: The Power of the Sacred Word and Number

> _MH HBVNH = M. A. B. N._
>
> _Nothing but a faint resemblance of the letter G! That is not the Master's word, nor a key to it. I fear the Master's word is forever lost._
>
> —from the Third, or Master Mason's, Degree

Within the Western Mystery Tradition, no legend better encapsulates the quest for esoteric knowledge than the Masonic allegory of the "lost word." The story centers on Hiram Abiff, King Solomon's chief architect, who is murdered for refusing to reveal the secret fourfold word of power. In the ritual of the Master Mason's Degree, the candidate symbolically relives Hiram's death and resurrection, a process culminating in the recovery of this word. Yet, the word whispered to the newly raised initiate—"MAH HAH BOH NAY"—is not the true word, but a substitute. Masonic rubrics write it as three syllables, but it is secretly pronounced as four, and its origin lies not in French or mere fancy, but in the sacred language of Hebrew.

As Hebrew, _Mah Hah Boh Nay_ (מה הבונה) translates to the question, "What? Is this the Builder's Word?" It is a coded inquiry, acknowledging that this is a placeholder for the true lost word: the Tetragrammaton, the four-lettered name of God (IHVH). This quest for a word of power, a sonic key that can unlock creation, is a foundational principle of esoteric philosophy. It presumes that the universe is encoded in a divine language, and that profound truths are revealed in the relationship between language, number, and cosmology.

The ancient Greek method of _isopsephism_, a form of gematria, provides a powerful illustration of this principle. By assigning a numerical value to each letter of the alphabet, hidden connections between seemingly disparate concepts can be revealed. Consider the Greek words _Agape_ (Αγάπη), meaning Love, and _Thelema_ (Θέλημα), meaning Will:

- **Αγάπη (Agape)** = α (1) + γ (3) + α (1) + π (80) + η (8) = **93**
- **Θέλημα (Thelema)** = θ (9) + ε (5) + λ (30) + η (8) + μ (40) + α (1) = **93**

The numerical equivalence of Love and Will to the number 93 is no mere coincidence; it is a revelation, suggesting a profound mystical identity between the two concepts. This manual serves as a practical reference and a working key to unlock these sacred languages and magickal systems. From the cosmological foundations of the elements and planets to the intricate alphanumeric codes of Hebrew, Greek, Runic, and Enochian traditions, the following sections provide the necessary tools for the modern researcher and practitioner to continue the Great Work of decoding the divine language of the universe.

### 2.0 Foundational Cosmological Correspondences

Before delving into the intricate alphanumeric codes of specific magickal languages, it is essential to grasp the foundational cosmological frameworks that underpin them. Across numerous esoteric traditions, a shared symbolic language emerges from the universal patterns of the elements, the seven classical planets, and the twelve signs of the zodiac. These systems provide the structural context and symbolic grammar upon which the sacred alphabets are built, allowing practitioners to map the macrocosm of the universe to the microcosm of the human soul.

#### 2.1 The Elemental Keys: The Building Blocks of Creation

The classification of the cosmos into a cycle of elements represents a primary building block in both Eastern and Western cosmological models. These systems, ranging from threefold to fivefold divisions, provide a fundamental key to understanding the nature of creation.

##### 1. The Threefold System

In Alchemy, the cosmos is understood through three root-essence elements: Sulfur, Salt, and Mercury. Sulfur represents the fiery, active male principle; Salt is the fluidic, receptive female principle; and their interaction gives rise to Mercury, the airy, androgynous, and equalizing force. This triadic system is mirrored in the Qabalistic _Sepher Yetzirah_, which uses the three Hebrew mother letters—Shin (Fire), Mem (Water), and Aleph (Air)—to categorize the 22 paths of the Tree of Life. A notable variation exists within the Golden Dawn tradition, which assigns Sulfur to red, Mercury to blue, and Salt to yellow, an alteration made to align the system with the colors of the five Hindu Tattvas.

| Attribute        | **Sulfur (Fire)** | **Mercury (Air)** | **Salt (Water)** |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| **Power**        | Penetrating       | Equalizing        | Yielding         |
| **Gender**       | Male              | Androgynous       | Female           |
| **Family**       | Father            | Child             | Mother           |
| **Color**        | Red               | Yellow            | Blue             |
| **Metallic**     | Golden            | Variegated        | Silvery          |
| **Tarot**        | Judgement         | The Fool          | The Hanged Man   |
| **Greek iAO**    | Alpha (First)     | Iota (Middle)     | Omega (Last)     |
| **Tree of Life** | Chockmah          | Kether            | Binah            |

##### 2. The Fourfold Systems

The division of creation into four elements is a cornerstone of Western esotericism, primarily expressed through two distinct ordering systems.

###### **Tetragrammaton Elemental Order**

Rooted in the Hebrew Qabalah, this system arranges the elements according to the four letters of the Tetragrammaton (IHVH), linking them to the archetypal family unit and the suits of the Tarot. This order—Fire, Water, Air, Earth—is considered the esoteric sequence used in modern magick.

| Attribute                                                                                                                            | **Fire (Yod)**                  | **Water (Heh)**                                         | **Air (Vav)**                                                                             | **Earth (Heh Final)**                        |

###### **Renaissance-Alchemical Elemental Order**

Derived from the Hellenistic tradition of Plato and Aristotle, this system orders the four elements as gradations of refined matter, from the most ethereal (Fire) to the densest (Earth). This is often considered the exoteric order.

| Attribute     | **Fire** | **Air** | **Water** | **Earth**  |
| ------------- | -------- | ------- | --------- | ---------- |
| **Quality**   | Hot      | Moist   | Cold      | Dry        |
| **Humor**     | Choler   | Phelgm  | Blood     | Melancholy |
| **Direction** | East     | West    | North     | South      |
| **Man**       | Mind     | Spirit  | Soul      | Body       |

##### 3. The Fivefold System

The fourfold elemental system can be expanded to five with the inclusion of Spirit, a system known as the Pentagrammaton. This corresponds to the Hebrew name for Jesus, _Yehoshuah_ (I-H-Sh-V-H), where the letter Shin (Spirit/Fire) is placed between the Heh and Vav of the Tetragrammaton. The fivefold model provides a crucial bridge between Western and Eastern elemental traditions.

###### **Western and Eastern Elements**

| Western                                              | Indian (Tattvas) | Chinese |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| <EsoIcon element="Spirit" fill="fuchsia" /> Spirit   | Akasha           | Earth   |
| <EsoIcon element="Air" fill="yellow" /> Air          | Vayu             | Wood    |
| <EsoIcon element="Fire" fill="red" /> Fire           | Tejas            | Fire    |
| <EsoIcon element="Water" fill="deepskyblue" /> Water | Apas             | Water   |
| <EsoIcon element="Earth" fill="seagreen" /> Earth    | Prithivi         | Metal   |

#### 2.2 The Planetary Keys: The Seven Celestial Spheres

The lore of the seven classical planets is a central pillar of the Western magickal tradition. From the seven days of the week to the seven alchemical metals, this celestial septenary provides a rich symbolic framework for understanding cosmic forces.

##### **1. Graeco-Roman Planetary Deities**

| Planet                               | Deity     |

| **Total:**                           |            | **3,751**    |

##### **3. Astrological Symbols & Alchemical Metals**

During the Renaissance, alchemists developed specific symbols for the seven planets, linking each to a corresponding metal.

| Planet & Symbol                        | Alchemical Metal |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| <EsoIcon planet="Sun" /> Sun ☉         | Gold             |

| <EsoIcon planet="Jupiter" /> Jupiter ♃ | Tin              |
| <EsoIcon planet="Saturn" /> Saturn ♄   | Lead             |

##### **4. Platonic Order and Greek Vowels**

The Platonic order of the planets, arranged by their cosmic spheres from the outermost (Saturn) to the innermost (Moon), corresponds to the seven Greek vowels.

###### **Platonic Planetary Order and the Seven Greek Vowels**

| Planet                               | Sphere  | Greek Vowel |
| ------------------------------------ | ------- | ----------- |

| <EsoIcon planet="Moon" /> Moon       | First   | Α (Alpha)   |

##### **5. Dee's Planetary Monad**

The 16th-century magician John Dee devised a single symbol, the _Monas Hieroglyphica_, to unite the powers of the seven planets. Each planetary symbol can be derived from the components of this master sigil.

###### **The Seven Planets on the Monad**

| Planet                               | Sign | Monad Derivation                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

##### **6. Days of the Week and Planetary Hours**

The cycle of the seven planets governs both the days of the week and the 168 hours within it. This entire system, crucial for determining auspicious times for magickal workings, is derived from the astrological attributions of the Greek alphabet. Each day is ruled by a planet, and each hour of that day falls under the influence of a specific planetary ruler in a repeating sequence.

###### **Planetary Ruler for the 168 Hours of the Week**

#### 2.3 The Zodiacal Keys: The Twelve Divisions of Heaven

The Zodiac is an ancient system that divides the celestial sphere into twelve 30-degree segments, each associated with a symbolic sign. This framework provides a detailed map for understanding temporal cycles and planetary influences.

##### **1. The Twelve Signs**

| Order | Name                                               | Image        |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1     | <EsoIcon sign="Aries" :includeName="true" />       | Ram          |
| 2     | <EsoIcon sign="Taurus" :includeName="true" />      | Bull         |
| 3     | <EsoIcon sign="Gemini" :includeName="true" />      | Twins        |
| 4     | <EsoIcon sign="Cancer" :includeName="true" />      | Crab         |
| 5     | <EsoIcon sign="Leo" :includeName="true" />         | Lion         |
| 6     | <EsoIcon sign="Virgo" :includeName="true" />       | Virgin       |
| 7     | <EsoIcon sign="Libra" :includeName="true" />       | Scales       |
| 8     | <EsoIcon sign="Scorpio" :includeName="true" />     | Scorpion     |
| 9     | <EsoIcon sign="Sagittarius" :includeName="true" /> | Centaur      |
| 10    | <EsoIcon sign="Capricorn" :includeName="true" />   | Goat-Fish    |
| 11    | <EsoIcon sign="Aquarius" :includeName="true" />    | Water-Bearer |
| 12    | <EsoIcon sign="Pisces" :includeName="true" />      | Fishes       |

##### **2. Elemental Divisions**

The twelve signs are grouped by element into four _triplicities_ (three signs per element) and by quality into three _quadruplicities_ (four signs per quality: Cardinal, Fixed, Mutable). The elemental grouping follows the Tetragrammaton order.

###### **Tetragrammaton Elemental Order as the Precession of the Signs**

| <EsoIcon element="Fire" :includeName="true" /> | <EsoIcon element="Water" :includeName="true" /> | <EsoIcon element="Air" :includeName="true" /> | <EsoIcon element="Earth" :includeName="true" /> |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Aries                                          | Pisces                                          | Aquarius                                      | Capricorn                                       |
| Sagittarius                                    | Scorpio                                         | Libra                                         | Virgo                                           |
| Leo                                            | Cancer                                          | Gemini                                        | Taurus                                          |

##### **3. Planetary Influences**

Each zodiacal sign is "ruled" by one of the seven classical planets, which exerts a primary influence over it. This creates an "alchemical ladder" of rulerships. Beyond simple rulership, planets have four states of dignity within a sign: Domicile (Rulership), Exaltation, Detriment, and Fall.

###### **Alchemical Ladder of Planetary Rulers for the Zodiac**

| Sign     | Planetary Ruler                      | Sign                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Cancer   | <EsoIcon planet="Moon" /> Moon       | <EsoIcon planet="Sun" /> Sun |
| Gemini   | <EsoIcon planet="Mercury" /> Mercury | Virgo                        |
| Taurus   | <EsoIcon planet="Venus" /> Venus     | Libra                        |
| Aries    | <EsoIcon planet="Mars" /> Mars       | Scorpio                      |
| Pisces   | <EsoIcon planet="Jupiter" /> Jupiter | Sagittarius                  |
| Aquarius | <EsoIcon planet="Saturn" /> Saturn   | Capricorn                    |

##### **4. Zodiac of the Human Body**

Astrological traditions link the twelve signs to different parts of the human body. The Hebrew Qabalah, particularly the _Sepher Yetzirah_, offers a distinct set of these correspondences.

| Zodiac          | Traditional            | Qabalistic   |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ------------ |
| **Aries**       | Head                   | Right hand   |
| **Taurus**      | Throat, neck           | Left hand    |
| **Gemini**      | Shoulders, arms, hands | Right foot   |
| **Cancer**      | Stomach                | Left foot    |
| **Leo**         | Heart                  | Right kidney |
| **Virgo**       | Intestines             | Left kidney  |
| **Libra**       | Kidneys                | Gall bladder |
| **Scorpio**     | Genitals               | Intestines   |
| **Sagittarius** | Hips, thighs           | Stomach      |
| **Capricorn**   | Knees                  | Liver        |
| **Aquarius**    | Ankles                 | Spleen       |
| **Pisces**      | Feet                   | Heart        |

##### **5. The Precession of the Equinoxes**

The Great Zodiacal Year refers to the slow "wobble" of the Earth's axis, which causes the position of the sunrise on the vernal equinox to move backward through the zodiacal signs over a period of roughly 25,920 years. Each "age," lasting approximately 2,160 years, is defined by the sign in which the equinox occurs.

###### **Precession of the Equinoxes**

| Age      | Period of Time      | Events                     | Zodiac   |
| -------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- | -------- |
| Taurian  | 4320 BCE - 2160 BCE | Origin of number, alphabet | Taurus   |
| Aryan    | 2160 BCE - 0        | Qabalah, I Ching           | Aries    |
| Piscean  | 0 - 2160 CE         | Christian Era, Tarot       | Pisces   |
| Aquarian | 2160 CE - 4320 CE   | The future of the world    | Aquarius |

Aleister Crowley proposed a different timeline, arguing the Age of Aquarius began in 1904 with his reception of _The Book of the Law_.

###### **Crowley's Precession of the Equinoxes**

| Age          | Time         | Society   | Cult    | Family | Egyptian Liber AL |
| ------------ | ------------ | --------- | ------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| **Aries**    | 2000 BCE - 0 | Matriarch | Goddess | Mother | Isis              |
| **Pisces**   | 0 - 1904 CE  | Patriarch | Jesus   | Father | Osiris            |
| **Aquarius** | 1904 CE - ?  | Equality  | Thelema | Child  | Horus             |

#### 2.4 The Art of Geomancy: An Oracle of Earth

Geomancy is a divinatory system, often considered the Western equivalent of the Chinese I Ching, based on 16 figures composed of four lines of either odd (one dot) or even (two dots) points. These figures are constructed from four fundamental two-line patterns, or _bigrams_, each with its own elemental and symbolic meaning.

##### **Four Bigrams of Geomancy**

| Bigram Shape | Element | Meaning                          | Geomancy Figure |
| ------------ | ------- | -------------------------------- | --------------- |
| •<br>•       | Air     | Access, movement, path (life)    | Via             |
| •<br>• •     | Fire    | Loss, blockage, off balance      | Amissio         |
| • •<br>•     | Water   | Gain, addition, in balance       | Acquisitio      |
| • •<br>• •   | Earth   | To collect, group, unite (death) | Populus         |

These universal cosmological systems—elemental, planetary, zodiacal, and geomantic—provide the essential context and symbolic architecture for understanding the specific alphanumeric codes of the magickal languages that follow.

#### 3.0 The Western Mystery Traditions

The esoteric traditions of the West, rooted primarily in the fertile grounds of Hebrew Qabalah, Greek philosophy, and Egyptian Hermeticism, developed a host of complex alphabetic and symbolic codes. These systems were designed not merely as methods of communication, but as comprehensive maps of the universe and the human soul, where each letter and number holds a key to divine wisdom. This section serves as a practical guide to these individual systems, offering the foundational knowledge needed to decipher their secrets.

#### 3.1 The Hebrew System: The Foundation of Western Qabalah

The Hebrew Qabalah is the cornerstone of the Western Mystery Tradition. Its 22-letter alphabet is not merely phonetic but serves as a complete cosmological, astrological, and spiritual framework.

##### **1. The Alphabet and Number Values**

Each Hebrew letter has both a nominal value (used in gematria) and a positional value (denoting its place in the alphabet). The alphabet also includes five "final" forms for letters that appear at the end of a word, which have distinct numerical values.

###### **Hebrew Alphabet Code**

| Letter     | Transliteration | Name         | Nominal Value | Positional Value |
| ---------- | --------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ---------------- |
| א          | A               | Aleph        | 1             | 1                |

##### **3. The 32 Paths of Wisdom**

The seminal Qabalistic text, the _Sepher Yetzirah_ ("Book of Formation"), describes the universe as being composed of 32 "wonderful paths of wisdom." These consist of the ten Sephiroth (numbers or emanations) and the 22 Hebrew letters that form the connecting paths between them on the Tree of Life. Each path is associated with a specific mode of intelligence.

#### 3.2 The Greek System: Philosophy and Gnosis

The Greek tradition contributed immensely to Western esotericism, providing sophisticated systems of number philosophy, alphanumeric codes, and Gnostic cosmology.

##### **1. Numeral Systems**

Ancient Greece utilized several methods for representing numbers before settling on the familiar alphanumeric system.

###### **Homeric Greek Numerals (Serial Order)**

| Letter | Value | Letter | Value | Letter | Value |
| ------ | ----- | ------ | ----- | ------ | ----- |
| A      | 1     | I      | 9     | R      | 17    |
| B      | 2     | K      | 10    | S      | 18    |
| G      | 3     | L      | 11    | T      | 19    |
| D      | 4     | M      | 12    | U      | 20    |
| E      | 5     | N      | 13    | Ph     | 21    |
| Z      | 6     | X      | 14    | Ch     | 22    |
| H      | 7     | O      | 15    | Ps     | 23    |
| Th     | 8     | P      | 16    | O      | 24    |

###### **Herodianic Greek Numerals (c. 600 BCE)**

This system resembled Roman numerals, using six select letters to represent powers of ten.

| Letter | Value  | Parallel Roman Numeral |
| ------ | ------ | ---------------------- |
| Ι      | 1      | I                      |
| Π      | 5      | V                      |
| Δ      | 10     | X                      |
| Η      | 100    | C                      |
| Χ      | 1,000  | M                      |
| Μ      | 10,000 |                        |

##### **2. Alphabetical Correspondences**

The standard Greek system assigns numerical values from 1 to 900 to its 24 letters, plus three archaic letters.

Runes were also used in calendrical calculations, with a specific code for the numbers 1 through 19, known as the "Golden Number Series."

##### **2. Ogham and Druidic Alphabets**

The Ogham is an ancient Irish script, often called the "tree alphabet," where each letter corresponds to a specific tree. The characters are formed by a series of straight lines incised along a central stem-line. A hand alphabet also exists, using fingers to represent the letters against a ridge line (such as the nose or arm). The ancient Beth-Luis-Nion (BLN) alphabet, a precursor to Ogham, encodes the sacred Qabalistic number 32 in its structure, suggesting a possible link between Celtic and Hebraic traditions.

#### 3.5 The Latin System: Renaissance Hermeticism

During the Renaissance, esotericists adapted the principles of the Hebrew Qabalah to the Latin alphabet, creating new systems for alphanumeric correspondence and cosmological mapping.

##### **1. The Art of Raymond Lull**

The 14th-century mystic Raymond Lull developed a system of concentric wheels inscribed with letters corresponding to divine attributes. By rotating the wheels, new combinations of concepts could be generated, forming a prototype for later cosmological graphs and even early computing. His Enneagram assigned the letters B through K to nine categories of virtues, vices, and philosophical questions.

###### **Lull's Enneagram**

| Letter | Virtues    | Vices      | Questions   | Categories |
| ------ | ---------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| **B**  | Justice    | Avarice    | Whether?    | Quantity   |
| **C**  | Prudence   | Gluttony   | What?       | Quality    |
| **D**  | Strength   | Excess     | From where? | Relation   |
| **E**  | Temperance | Arrogance  | Why?        | Active     |
| **F**  | Faith      | Bitterness | How much?   | Passive    |
| **G**  | Hope       | Envy       | What kind?  | Nature     |
| **H**  | Charity    | Sloth      | When?       | Time       |
| **I**  | Patience   | Anger      | Where?      | Position   |
| **K**  | Humility   | Lying      | How?        | State      |

##### **2. Latin Ciphers**

Several ciphers were developed to assign numerical values to the Latin alphabet, often reducing it to 22 letters to parallel the Hebrew model.

#### 3.6 The Enochian System: The Angelic Language of John Dee

The Enochian system, received by Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelley in the late 16th century, is one of the most complex and powerful magickal languages in the Western tradition. It includes a unique 21-letter alphabet and an elaborate cosmology based on four great "Watchtowers."

##### **1. The Enochian Alphabet**

The alphabet has several numbering systems attributed to it by Dee, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and Aleister Crowley.

##### **2. Grammatical Analysis**

Research suggests that Enochian is an artificial, or constructed, language rather than a natural one. This is evidenced by its inconsistent grammatical structure, where the addition of a single letter to a root word arbitrarily changes its meaning without a logical pattern.

###### **Enochian Grammatical Terminative**

| Letter Added to Root | Grammatical Effect | Example (Root: LUSD - "feet")                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **A**                | -ing, their        | LUSDA - "their feet"                             |
| **D**                | thy                | -                                                |
| **E**                | with               | -                                                |
| **I**                | my                 | LUSDI - "my feet"                                |
| **L**                | shall              | TORZUL - "shall rise" (from TORZU - "arise")     |
| **ON**               | of...              | ALDON - "of gathering" (from ALDI - "gather up") |

##### **3. The Rectified Watchtowers**

The complex lettered squares of the four Enochian Watchtowers have often been published with scribal errors. The following information is presented as a correction to these versions. The true pattern behind the Watchtowers is based on 91 seven-lettered names of Angelic Governors, which are derived from seven tangent squares on the tablets. Below is a simplified reconstruction of the Air Watchtower demonstrating this rectified structure, with the Great Central Cross highlighted to show its form.

##### **4. Angelic Hierarchy**

Within each of the four Watchtowers resides a complex hierarchy of 88 names of power, in addition to the 22 Angelic Governors. This creates a total of 444 God names within the complete system.

#### 3.7 The Tarot: A Pictorial Key to the Mysteries

The Tarot is a system of 78 cards that serves not only as a tool for divination but also as a comprehensive pictorial key to the Western Mysteries, particularly the Hebrew Qabalah.

##### **1. Divinatory Meanings**

The core divinatory meanings for the cards were codified by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, drawing heavily on the Qabalistic research of S.L. MacGregor Mathers. The following tables provide a concise reference.

##### **2. The Esoteric Qabalistic Structure**

S.L. MacGregor Mathers was instrumental in revealing the secret structure connecting the Tarot to the Qabalah, a system that underpins all modern esoteric Tarot interpretation.

- **Major Arcana:** The 22 Major Arcana cards correspond to the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet and the 22 paths connecting the Sephiroth on the Tree of Life. Mathers rectified the traditional order to align with the astrological attributes given in the _Sepher Yetzirah_.

###### **The Rectified Hebraic Order of the Tarot**

| Tarot Key                  | Hebrew Letter | Astrological Attribute               |
| -------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **0. The Fool**            | Aleph (א)     | Air                                  |
| **I. The Magician**        | Beth (ב)      | <EsoIcon planet="Mercury" /> Mercury |
| **II. The High Priestess** | Gimel (ג)     | <EsoIcon planet="Moon" /> Moon       |

| **VI. The Lovers**         | Zain (ז)      | Gemini                               |

| **IX. The Hermit**         | Yod (י)       | Virgo                                |

| **XI. Justice**            | Lamed (ל)     | Libra                                |

| **XIV. Temperance**        | Samekh (ס)    | Sagittarius                          |

| **XXI. The World**         | Tav (ת)       | <EsoIcon planet="Saturn" /> Saturn   |

- **Minor Arcana:** The four suits correspond to the four Qabalistic worlds, and the ten numbered cards in each suit correspond to the ten Sephiroth of the Tree of Life.

###### **Four Qabalistic Worlds**

| World                    | Tarot Suit | Tetragrammaton | Element |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | -------------- | ------- |
| **Atziloth** (Archetype) | Wands      | Yod (I)        | Fire    |
| **Briah** (Creative)     | Cups       | Heh (H)        | Water   |
| **Yetzirah** (Formative) | Swords     | Vav (V)        | Air     |
| **Assiah** (Action)      | Pentacles  | Heh Final (Hf) | Earth   |

- **Court Cards:** The four ranks of the Court Cards (Knight, Queen, King, Page) correspond to the four letters of the Tetragrammaton and the archetypal family unit of Father, Mother, Son, and Daughter.

##### **3. Symbolism of the Waite Deck**

The Tarot deck designed by A.E. Waite and illustrated by Pamela Colman Smith is rich with hidden symbolism that encodes the Golden Dawn's esoteric correspondences.

- **The High Priestess:** The crescent moon at her feet explicitly links her to the Moon, the attribute of the Hebrew letter Gimel, clarifying her position as Key II. The pillars, Jachin and Boaz, and the veil behind her further cement her Qabalistic role.
- **The Emperor:** The four rams' heads adorning the throne are a blatant clue to this card's correspondence with the zodiacal sign of Aries, the Ram, and the Hebrew letter Heh. The predominant use of red aligns with the Golden Dawn's color scale for Aries.
- **The Chariot:** This card's ruler is Cancer, which is governed by the Moon. Waite encodes this with the crescent moons on the Charioteer's shoulders and the starry canopy representing the heavens through which the Moon travels. The two sphinxes, one black and one white, represent the dual forces the Charioteer must balance.
- **The Devil:** The goat's head and the inverted pentagram directly link this card to the zodiacal sign of Capricorn, the Goat. The astrological sigil for Saturn, Capricorn's planetary ruler, is subtly inscribed in the Devil's raised right hand.
- **The Tower:** The lightning bolt that strikes the tower is a direct visual reference to the astrological symbol for Mars (a circle with a projecting arrow). This identifies the card's correspondence with the planet Mars and the Hebrew letter Peh. The 22 yellow flames in the sky represent the 22 paths of the Tree of Life.

The intricate symbolic languages of the West, with their layered meanings and cosmological depth, now give way to the ancient and distinct systems of the East.

### 4.0 The Eastern Mystery Traditions

This section explores the sacred languages and cosmological models of the East. While these traditions—from the ancient cuneiform of Sumeria to the profound systems of India and China—developed separately from those of the West, they often share fundamental principles. Here too, we find a deep and abiding correspondence between number, symbol, cosmology, and spiritual concepts, revealing a universal human impulse to decode the structure of reality.

#### 4.1 Cuneiform: The Dawn of Alphanumeric Symbolism

Sumerian Cuneiform, one of the world's oldest writing systems, represents a proto-magickal language. While not a fully isopsephic system where every word could be numbered, it possessed a limited cryptographic code where specific number signs were used in place of certain god-names in astrological and magickal texts.

#### 4.2 The Arabic System: Sufi Mysticism and Cosmology

The Arabic esoteric tradition, particularly within Sufism, developed a rich system of alphanumeric correspondences that parallels the Hebrew Qabalah.

##### **1. Number Codes**

Two primary numbering systems exist for the 28-letter Arabic alphabet. The Eastern (Abjad or Egyptian) system rearranges the alphabet to match the Hebrew order and is the primary code for esoteric work. The Western (Moroccan) system follows the normal sequential order of the alphabet.

##### **2. The 99 Beautiful Names of God**

The Quran provides 99 names, or attributes, for God. Each name possesses a distinct numerical value and is used in mystical practice and talismanic magick.

###### **Selected Names of God**

#### 4.3 The Sanskrit System: Vedic and Tantrik Keys

The sacred language of Sanskrit is the foundation for several complex numerical and spiritual systems integral to Vedic and Tantrik traditions.

##### **1. Number Codes**

Several esoteric codes exist for numbering the Sanskrit alphabet, including the _KaTaPaYa_ system and the _ARYaBhaTa_ system. These codes allow for the transformation of words and verses into numerical formulas.

##### **2. The Chakra System**

The Chakra system describes seven primary energy centers located along the spine, from the base to the crown of the head. Each chakra is associated with an element, a psychological function, and a specific number of "petals" corresponding to letters of the Sanskrit alphabet.

###### **Basic Attributes of the Seven Chakras**

| Order | Sanskrit Name | English Name | Location         | Element       |
| ----- | ------------- | ------------ | ---------------- | ------------- |
| 1     | Muladhara     | Root         | Base of spine    | Earth         |

#### 4.5 The Chinese System: Taoist Cosmology and the I Ching

Chinese esoteric thought is built on a sophisticated cosmology that predates many Western systems. Its principles have been preserved and elaborated through Taoist philosophy and divination.

##### **1. Cosmological Foundations**

The core concepts are _Yin-Yang_—the passive, feminine (Yin) and active, masculine (Yang) principles whose interplay generates all phenomena—and the Five Elements. The Chinese elements operate in cycles of creation and destruction, providing a dynamic model of cosmic harmony.

###### **Harmony of the Five Chinese Elements**

| Element   | Parent (Creates) | Child (Is Created By) | Enemy (Destroys) | Friend (Is Destroyed By) |
| --------- | ---------------- | --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Wood**  | Water            | Fire                  | Metal            | Earth                    |
| **Fire**  | Wood             | Earth                 | Water            | Metal                    |
| **Earth** | Fire             | Metal                 | Wood             | Water                    |
| **Metal** | Earth            | Water                 | Fire             | Wood                     |
| **Water** | Metal            | Wood                  | Earth            | Fire                     |

##### **2. The I Ching**

The _I Ching_, or "Book of Changes," is an ancient divinatory text based on 64 six-line figures called _hexagrams_. Each hexagram is composed of two three-line figures, or _trigrams_. The eight basic trigrams form the fundamental building blocks of the system.

###### **The Eight Basic Trigrams**

| Trigram | Name                         | Meaning           | Element   |
| ------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| **☰**  | Ch'ien                       | The Creative      | Sky       |
| **☱**  | Tui                          | The Joyful        | Lake      |
| **☲**  | Li                           | The Clinging      | Fire      |
| **☳**  | Chen                         | The Arousing      | Thunder   |
| **☴**  | <EsoIcon planet="Sun" /> Sun | The Gentle        | Wood/Wind |
| **☵**  | K'an                         | The Abysmal       | Water     |
| **☶**  | Ken                          | The Keeping Still | Mountain  |
| **☷**  | K'un                         | The Receptive     | Earth     |

Each of the 64 hexagrams has a core judgment providing oracular guidance. For example:

- **Hexagram 1: Ch'ien (The Creative):** _Judgment: The Creative works sublime success, furthering through perseverance._
- **Hexagram 2: K'un (The Receptive):** _Judgment: The Receptive brings about sublime success, furthering through the perseverance of a mare._
- **Hexagram 11: T'ai (Peace):** _Judgment: Peace. The small departs and the great approaches. Good fortune. Success._

##### **3. Numbering Calligraphy**

A primary method for assigning numerical values in Chinese is based on the number of strokes required to execute a given calligraphic character. For instance, a character written with eight strokes has a value of 8. This system is foundational to numerological analysis in Chinese culture.

These Eastern systems transition us to our final section, which explores significant traditions from the New World and the modern era.

### 5.0 Other Significant Systems

This final section covers important esoteric systems that fall outside the primary East-West geographic classification, including the rich calendrical traditions of pre-Columbian America and the modern application of ancient Qabalistic principles to the English language.

#### 5.1 New World Calendrical Systems

For the ancient Aztec and Mayan civilizations, the symbolism for the first 20 numbers was deeply embedded in their calendrical day signs. Their primary cosmic year was a 260-day cycle (13 months of 20 days), which was later harmonized with a 365-day solar year (18 months of 20 days, plus five "empty" days). The Mayans developed three distinct sets of symbolic images for these 20 numbers:

1. **The Day Glyphs:** Hieroglyphic images for each of the 20 days, paralleling the Aztec system.
2. **The God Head Count:** A series of alternate glyphs based on the heads of deities.
3. **Bar and Circle Notation:** A numerical system where a dot represents one and a bar represents five.

This intricate calendrical numerology demonstrates a highly sophisticated and unique approach to encoding cosmological principles within a symbolic framework.

#### 5.2 The English Language: Modern Esoteric Applications

Inspired by the Hebrew Qabalah, modern esotericists have applied similar principles to the 26-letter English alphabet, developing various systems of numerology and symbolic interpretation.

##### **1. Numbering Systems**

Several systems exist for assigning numerical values to the English alphabet. The most common are the simple serial order and two Pythagorean-style reduction systems.

| Letter | ABC Serial Order | Fadic Numerology | Modern Numerology |
| ------ | ---------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| **A**  | 1                | 1                | 1                 |

##### **2. Hieroglyphic Meanings**

Each English letter can also be interpreted as a symbolic picture or hieroglyph based on its shape.

- **A:** The pyramid and its capstone; the Masonic compass; an arrowhead; the ox head and horns.
- **G:** The crescent Moon and the Tau cross; a spiral; the coiled serpent Kundalini; the rose-cross.
- **H:** A ladder reaching to heaven; the two pillars of the temple joined by a veil; the sign of infinity.
- **I:** The erect phallus; the spine; the world-axis; the wand of the magician.
- **Z:** The lightning bolt descending from the heavens; as above, so below; the zigzag path.

##### **3. The Significance of 26 and 93**

Certain numbers have gained prominence in modern esotericism due to significant Qabalistic correspondences.

- **26:** This number is paramount in Qabalah as the numerical value of the Hebrew Tetragrammaton, **IHVH** (10+5+6+5 = 26). Remarkably, using the ABC Serial Order, the English word **GOD** also equals 26 (7+15+4 = 26), creating a direct link between the supreme name of God in Hebrew and English.
- **93:** This number is central to the system of Thelema, founded by Aleister Crowley. As shown in the introduction, it is the numerical value of both the Greek words **Thelema** (Will) and **Agape** (Love), signifying their mystical unity.

### 6.0 Conclusion: Towards a Universal Magickal Language

This manual has journeyed through a diverse landscape of sacred languages and magickal systems, from the foundational cosmological keys of the West to the ancient alphanumeric codes of the East and their modern English applications. What emerges from this comparative study is not a collection of disparate curiosities, but a profound testament to a universal human endeavor: the quest to understand the hidden structure of the cosmos through the interplay of symbol, number, and language.

The primary mission inspiring this work has been the reconstruction of the fabled Rosicrucian "Magickal Language Dictionary," a text referred to as _Liber Thesaurus_. This legendary book was envisioned as a comprehensive lexicon cataloging the world's sacred languages by their numerical values, serving as an oracle and a key to the divine language of the universe.

While that original text may be lost to time, the spirit of its creation lives on. The keys provided in this manual—the tables of correspondence, the explanations of cosmological patterns, and the deciphering of esoteric alphabets—are intended to empower the modern student, researcher, and practitioner. They are the tools needed to continue this Great Work, to explore the infinite nuances of meaning hidden within number, and to participate in the ongoing act of decoding the divine language through which the universe speaks.
