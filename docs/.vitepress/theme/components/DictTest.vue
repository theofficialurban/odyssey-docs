      Underneath the beautiful starry sky, John experienced an epiphany. He had
      always loved stargazing, but this evening, the stars felt more ethereal
      than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as if the universe was revealing itself to him in a completely new
      way. It was pure serendipity that he had chosen to take out his telescope
      this evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      He realized he was part of something bigger, something that was both a
      paradox and the quintessential essence of life. He felt both insignificant
      and important at the same time, a piece of the universe's grand puzzle.
