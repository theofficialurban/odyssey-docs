### _A History of Zoroastrianism by Mary Boyce (Vols 1 & 2)_

![](https://i.imgur.com/U76N9Vy.png)

This excerpt provides an in-depth examination of the origins, theology, and ritual practices of **Zoroastrianism**, emphasizing its foundation in ancient **Indo-Iranian religious traditions**. The central premise is the reliance on the remarkably consistent Zoroastrian tradition to interpret the message of **Zoroaster**, a priest who reformed the ancient faith. Key themes explored include the Indo-Iranian social structure of **three classes** (warrior, priest, and common man) and the significance of early deities, particularly the **Ahuras** like Ahura Mazda (Lord Wisdom) and Mithra, whose concepts of justice and contract were vital. The text also details the cosmic dualism between Ahura Mazda and **Angra Mainyu** (the Hostile Spirit), the Zoroastrian doctrine of the **seven creations** (sky, water, earth, etc.) protected by the **Amoša Spontas**, and the eschatological beliefs centered on the coming **Saošyant** who will bring about the final **Frašō.kereti** (Rehabilitation) of the world. Finally, it addresses the unique, stringent **purity laws** surrounding death and the venerated elements of fire and water, contrasting them with pre-Zoroastrian pagan customs.

#### Volume II

This scholarly excerpt, likely from a comprehensive history of Zoroastrianism, meticulously examines the development and spread of the faith, particularly **under the Achaemenian Empire** (circa 6th to 4th centuries B.C.). The text explores diverse facets of the religion, including its theological core—such as the roles of divinities like **Khsathra Vairya** (Desirable Dominion) and **Ahuramazda** (the Creator God)—and its practical implementation, including daily observances and yearly feasts that ensured the faith's remarkable **survival and coherence**. A major theme is the complex **religious syncretism and influence** between Iranian, Babylonian, and Greek cultures, evident in the adoption of image-worship (especially the assimilation of *Anahiti/Ishtar*) and the impact of Zoroastrian cosmological ideas on early Greek philosophy. Finally, the source analyzes archaeological and epigraphic evidence, from royal tombs and inscriptions (like those of **Cyrus the Great** and **Darius the Great**) to administrative tablets, to chart the political, priestly, and geographical expansion of the faith across the ancient Near East and Asia Minor.

#### Volume III

This academic text, "A History of Zoroastrianism, Vol. III," by Mary Boyce and Frantz Grenet, represents a significant **scholarly undertaking** dedicated to exploring the history of the Zoroastrian religion. As the third volume in a series, it suggests a **comprehensive and detailed examination** of the faith's evolution and geographical spread. The purpose of this book is to provide an authoritative account of the religion founded by the prophet Zarathushtra (Zoroaster), likely focusing on a specific period or set of themes to offer deep insight into the **cultural and historical context** of Zoroastrianism. Published by Brill, a renowned academic press, the work is intended for researchers and students interested in ancient Iranian history and religious studies.

### _Zoroastrianism: A Shadowy, but Powerful Presence in the Judaeo-Christian World_

This source is an excerpt from a 1987 lecture by Mary Boyce, a renowned scholar of Iranian Studies, titled **"Zoroastrianism: A Shadowy but Powerful Presence in the Judaeo-Christian World,"** which was the forty-first lecture sponsored by the Friends of Dr. Williams’s Library. The central purpose of the text is to argue for the profound, though often overlooked, influence of Zoroastrian religious doctrines on the development of Jewish and Christian thought, particularly concerning **eschatology** (beliefs about the end of time). Boyce explores two main propositions: first, the **"powerful presence"** of Zoroastrianism, both through the political dominion of the Persian Empire and the inherent strength of its sophisticated theology, and second, why this presence was **"shadowy"**—due to the Zoroastrians’ reliance on oral tradition instead of written texts and a lack of visible religious artifacts. The document highlights key Zoroastrian beliefs, such as radical **dualism** between the good Ahura Mazda and the evil Angra Mainyu, the **Last Judgment** by fiery ordeal, the resurrection of the body, and the ultimate **extinction of evil**, proposing that these concepts were disseminated into the Hellenistic world, partly through influential Greek-language writings like the **Persian Sibylline Oracles**, which were then adapted by Jewish writers.

### _Zurvan: A Zoroastrian Dilemma_

This scholarly excerpt delves into the complex theological debates and sectarianism within Zoroastrianism, primarily focusing on the relationship between orthodox **Mazdean dualism** and the controversial **Zervanite doctrine**. The text highlights the Zervanite belief that **Zurvan**, or Time, was the superior, primordial deity and the father of the twin cosmic adversaries, **Ohrmazd (good)** and **Ahriman (evil)**. The author analyzes various Pahlavi books, particularly the *Dēnkart* and *Bundahišn*, noting the challenges of interpreting their corrupted texts and observing how later Mazdean orthodoxy attempted to **eliminate or disguise Zervanite ideas**, often by assimilating concepts like Time and Space into aspects of Ohrmazd. Key Zervanite myths, such as Zurvan's doubt leading to the conception of the twins and the incest myth surrounding the creation of the luminaries, are discussed using evidence from Armenian, Manichaean, and Christian sources, demonstrating the ongoing struggle over defining the origin of good and evil within the religion.

### _The Dawn & Twilight of Zoroastrianism (Putnam History of Religion)_

This scholarly text provides an in-depth analysis of **Zoroastrianism's historical development and theological complexities**, spanning its prophetic origins to its later decline. The source meticulously examines the core dualistic struggle between **Truth (Asha) and the Lie (Druj)**, highlighting Zoroaster's original monotheistic vision centered on the Wise Lord, Ahura Mazdah, and his condemnation of older polytheistic practices like the ritual slaughter of the bull and the intoxicating Haoma cult. Crucially, the work details the evolution of the faith, including the **reintroduction of marginalized deities** like Mithra, who became a prominent warlord and contract god, and the influence of the Magi, a hereditary priestly caste, particularly in Western Iran. Finally, it explores the later Sassanian attempts to establish religious orthodoxy, the rise of different sects like the dualistic "Mazdean" and **Zurvanite fatalists**, and the ultimate decline of Zoroastrianism following the rise of Islam, with key concepts such as the human soul’s free will, the role of divine instruments like the Bounteous Immortals, and the final eschatological renewal (Frashkart) providing a detailed structure to the religious tradition.

## A Comparative Theological Analysis: From Pagan Iranian Polytheism to the Revelations of Zoroaster

### Introduction: The Prophet and the Pantheon

Before the advent of the prophet Zoroaster, the religious landscape of ancient Iran was defined by a complex and ancient polytheistic faith. This system, deeply rooted in the shared Indo-Iranian heritage of the steppe peoples, bore a close resemblance to the Vedic religion of ancient India. It was a world populated by a pantheon of powerful divinities, some representing profound ethical concepts and others embodying the fierce, amoral forces of nature and war. Into this established theological world came Zoroaster, a figure who should be understood not as the founder of an entirely new religion, but as a visionary reformer of revolutionary depth. He did not discard the existing framework but radically reinterpreted it, transforming its very foundations.

This paper presents a comparative analysis of the pivotal theological shifts and the crucial threads of continuity between the pagan Iranian faith and the revelations of Zoroaster. By examining the core doctrines concerning the nature of divinity, the structure and purpose of the cosmos, the fate of the soul after death, and the fundamental ethical imperatives guiding human life, we can illuminate the profound transformation that occurred—a revolution that reordered the heavens, moralized the material world, and placed the conscious choice of the individual human being at the center of a cosmic struggle between absolute good and absolute evil.

### 1. The Conception of the Divine: A Revolution in Heaven

The most fundamental innovation introduced by Zoroaster was a radical restructuring of the divine order. Where the pagan faith recognized a pantheon of powerful, sometimes morally ambiguous deities, Zoroaster's revelation established a starkly defined cosmic conflict between a single, supreme, and wholly benevolent God and a co-eternal, uncreated force of pure malice. This was not merely a change in emphasis but a complete theological re-imagining that reshaped the very nature of divinity and its relationship with the world.

#### 1.1. The Pre-Zoroastrian Pantheon: The World of Ahuras and Daevas

The divine beings of the pagan Iranian faith were broadly divided into two primary classes with Indo-Iranian origins: the _**Ahuras**_ (Sanskrit: _Asuras_) and the _**Daevas**_. This division, which Zoroaster would later sharpen into a moral absolute, was initially more a matter of character and function.

The **Ahuras** were a class of deities who personified abstract moral and social concepts, representing order and the principles that governed society. They were the "Lords" of the pantheon, and at their head stood a great triad:

- **Mithra**: The powerful personification of covenant, contract, and loyalty. As the divine judge, Mithra was the celestial overseer of all sworn agreements, from personal oaths to solemn treaties between rulers. He was a vigilant and stern upholder of _asa_ (cosmic and social order), and his worship elevated the social contract to a sacred act. His association with the all-seeing sun is clear, but his primary link to fire stemmed from ancient practice, as oaths were sworn before the fire as a solemn, physical witness to the compact he enforced.
- _**Vouruna / Apam Napat**_: Often referred to simply as "the Ahura" or "high Lord," this deity was a great creator god associated with the cosmic waters. As the Iranian counterpart to the Vedic Varuna, he was a figure of supreme authority. The Avestan texts indicate that _Vouruna_, also known under the name Apam Napat ("Son of the Waters"), was hailed for having "created men, who shaped men." Zoroaster’s teachings not only diminished his prominence but directly transferred his core creative functions. The mechanics of this theological substitution are made explicit in the Avestan texts, where the very liturgical language once used for Apam Napat (_yō narə̄uš dada, yō narə̄uš tataša_) is almost exactly paralleled in a later hymn to Ahura Mazda: "who created us, who shaped (us)" (_yō nō dada, yō tataša_).
- **The pagan Ahura Mazda**: Before Zoroaster's revelation, Ahura Mazda was a lesser _Ahura_. His name signifies the "Wise Lord," linking him to the concept of wisdom (_mazda_). He was one of several Lords in the pantheon, recognized but not supreme. It was this divinity whom Zoroaster, in a moment of profound insight, would elevate above all others.

The **Daevas**, in contrast, were powerful, ancient gods, often associated with the forces of nature and war. Figures such as Indra, a mighty warrior god in the Vedic tradition, belonged to this class. While worshiped in the pagan era, they were characterized by an amoral strength that, in Zoroaster’s later ethical framework, would be condemned as actively malevolent.

#### 1.2. Zoroaster's Revelation: The Supremacy of Ahura Mazda and the Dualist Choice

Zoroaster’s teachings constituted a theological revolution. At its core was the elevation of **Ahura Mazda** to the status of the one, uncreated, wholly good, and supreme God. He was not merely the chief of the gods, but the transcendent source of all that is good, light, and orderly in the universe.

In opposition to this single God, Zoroaster posited a co-eternal, uncreated, and purely malevolent being: **Aŋra Mainyu**, the "Hostile Spirit." The prophet's theology is fundamentally defined by the doctrine of the two primordial Spirits (_Mainyus_) who, at the beginning of time, made a foundational choice. The "Bounteous Spirit," **Spənta Mainyu**, is the creative aspect or emanation of Ahura Mazda, through whom the good world was brought into being. Aŋra Mainyu, by contrast, is an independent and hostile principle. As Zoroaster explains in his hymns, the _Gathas_:

The two spirits first met, they created both life and not-life, and that there should be at the last the worst existence for the followers of the Drug, but, for the followers of Aša, the best dwelling. Of the two spirits, the one who follows the Lie chose to do the worst things; the Most Bounteous Spirit... chose Aša.

This choice between **Aša** (Truth, Order, Righteousness) and **Drug** (The Lie, Disorder, Falsehood) established the fundamental dualism of existence. The relationship between Ahura Mazda and Spənta Mainyu is complex; while Spənta Mainyu is the Bounteous Spirit through whom Ahura Mazda creates, orthodox Zoroastrian tradition frequently identifies Ahura Mazda with his own Bounteous Spirit, placing God himself in direct opposition to the Hostile Spirit.

#### 1.3. A New Hierarchy: The Aməša Spəntas, Yazatas, and the Rejection of the Daevas

Having established this supreme dualism, Zoroaster systematically reorganized the existing divine order to fit his new vision. The beneficent powers were re-conceived as the creations and servants of Ahura Mazda, while the old _daevas_ were explicitly demonized.

This new order is embodied by the seven **Aməša Spəntas**, or "Bounteous Immortals," the great divinities who preside over creation. They are Ahura Mazda himself and the six great beings he created to aid him in governing the universe. In a doctrine of profound originality, Zoroaster linked each of these seven divine beings to one of the seven physical creations, thereby inextricably weaving ethics into the fabric of the material world. This sevenfold correspondence is central to Zoroastrian theology:

1. The **Sky**, and the metals within it, are guarded by **Khšathra Vairya** (Desirable Dominion).
2. **Water** is guarded by **Haurvatāt** (Wholeness/Health).
3. The **Earth** is guarded by **Spənta Ārmaiti** (Bounteous Devotion).
4. **Plants** are guarded by **Amərətāt** (Long Life/Immortality).
5. **Cattle** (representing all beneficent animal life) are guarded by **Vohu Manah** (Good Purpose).
6. The **Righteous Man** (humanity) is under the direct guardianship of **Ahura Mazda** himself.
7. **Fire** is guarded by **Aša Vahišta** (Best Righteousness).

This doctrine transformed acts like keeping water pure or tending to livestock from simple husbandry into forms of worship. The other benevolent pagan deities were not discarded but re-categorized into the class of _**Yazatas**_—beings "worthy of worship." Figures like Mithra, Sraosha (Obedience), and the river goddess Arədvī Sūrā Anāhitā retained their importance and their hymns of praise, but they were now understood to be created by and subordinate to Ahura Mazda, serving his will in the cosmic struggle.

Finally, Zoroaster explicitly condemned the _daevas_ as malevolent beings, the offspring of Aŋra Mainyu and the forces of the Lie. They were to be actively rejected and fought against. This rejection became a cornerstone of the Zoroastrian confession of faith, the _**Fravaranē**_, in which the believer declares, "I profess myself a Mazda-worshipper and a Zoroastrian, having forsworn the daēvas."

The moralization of the divine hierarchy, transforming it into an ethical command structure for a cosmic war, necessitated a parallel re-interpretation of the physical world itself—no longer a static stage, but the very territory being fought over.

### 2. Cosmology: The Moralization of the Material World

While Zoroaster largely adopted the existing physical structure of the cosmos from his ancestors, he fundamentally re-interpreted its _purpose_. In his teachings, the universe was no longer just a divinely ordered stage for human and divine activity; it became an active and crucial battleground for the universal moral conflict between Aša and Drug. Every element of the material world was imbued with ethical significance and became a bastion to be defended for Ahura Mazda or a target for the corrupting assaults of Aŋra Mainyu.

#### 2.1. The Pagan Conception of the Cosmos

The pre-Zoroastrian Iranians held a systematic and detailed view of the world's structure, which they conceived as a seven-stage creation. This cosmology was likely the product of generations of priestly speculation, a scholastic essay in early physics providing a coherent model of the universe.

1. First was the creation of the **sky**, envisioned as a perfectly round, hollow shell made of **rock-crystal**.
2. Second, **water** was created, filling the lower half of this celestial shell.
3. Third, the flat, circular **earth** was formed, resting upon the primordial waters. It was believed to be divided into seven continents, or _karšvars_, with the central continent of Khvaniratha being the one inhabited by humanity.
4. Fourth came the creation of **plants**.
5. Fifth was the **Uniquely-created Bull**, the prototype and origin of all beneficent animal life.
6. Sixth was the First Man, **Gayō.marətan**, the progenitor of the human race.
7. The seventh creation was **Fire**, both as a physical element and a spiritual force pervading the world.

At the center of the earth stood the mythical mountain **Harā**, around which the sun, moon, and stars were believed to circle, creating the cycles of day and night. In this framework, human action—specifically correct ritual worship—was essential. By performing sacrifices and chanting hymns, humanity provided the gods with the strength they needed to maintain the cosmic order, or _**asa**_, causing the sun to rise, the rains to fall, and the world to remain in its proper rhythm.

#### 2.2. The Zoroastrian World as a Battleground

Zoroaster took this existing cosmological model and imbued it with a profound ethical dualism. He taught that the history of the world unfolds in three distinct stages, transforming the passive stage of creation into a dramatic, purpose-driven narrative:

1. _**Bundahišn**_ **(Creation):** This was the initial period when Ahura Mazda, through his Bounteous Spirit, created the world in a perfect, unblemished state, first spiritually (_mēnōg_) and then materially (_gētīg_).
2. _**Gumezišn**_ **(Mixture):** This is the present age, which began with the violent assault of Aŋra Mainyu upon Ahura Mazda's perfect creation. The Hostile Spirit burst through the sky, attacked the waters, earth, and all living things, introducing death, decay, sickness, pain, and all forms of evil into the world. He slew the Uniquely-created Bull and the First Man, but from their purified seed sprang all the world's animals and the first human couple. This cosmic invasion created the "mixed" state in which humanity now lives, where good and evil are perpetually intertwined and in conflict.
3. _**Frašō.kərǝti**_ **(Renovation):** This is the final stage of cosmic history, marking the eventual and certain victory of good over evil. At the end of time, evil will be utterly defeated and expelled from creation, and the world will be restored—"made wonderful"—to its original, perfected state, free from death, decay, and suffering.

This framework gives human existence a clear and urgent purpose. Every individual is a soldier in the cosmic war, tasked with aiding Ahura Mazda by defending the seven creations. By living righteously, practicing agriculture, keeping the earth and waters pure, and revering fire, a person is not merely obeying a divine command but is actively weakening the power of Aŋra Mainyu and helping to purify and restore the material world. The new status of the cosmos as a battleground thus endows every individual's life with ultimate meaning, the sum of which is weighed at the soul's final reckoning.

### 3. Eschatology and the Soul: From Earthly Shadows to Final Judgment

The pagan Iranian beliefs about the afterlife were a mixture of ancient, sometimes vague concepts, offering different fates for different social classes. Zoroaster replaced this with a clear, systematic, and universal soteriology. His teachings provided a detailed account of the soul's journey after death, culminating in a personal judgment based on ethical merit and a final, cosmic resolution that promised salvation and everlasting life to all righteous individuals, regardless of their station.

#### 3.1. Pagan Beliefs in the Afterlife

The older Iranian tradition held two distinct and co-existing beliefs regarding the fate of the dead.

- **A Subterranean Kingdom**: An ancient and popular belief centered on a subterranean kingdom of the dead, ruled by the mythical hero-king **Yima**. This was a shadowy realm, an underworld to which the spirits of the common people were thought to descend.
- **A Heavenly Paradise**: A later, more aristocratic belief developed alongside the older concept, positing a heavenly Paradise reserved for the souls of elite warriors and priests. This celestial realm was a place of light and happiness, accessible only to the highest echelons of society.

This dual vision of the afterlife was mirrored by a dual conception of the soul itself:

- _**Urvan:**_ This term referred to the individual's soul or spirit, the conscious self that faced a particular fate after the death of the body. It was the _urvan_ that journeyed to either Yima's kingdom or the heavenly Paradise.
- _**Fravashi:**_ A more primitive concept, the _fravashi_ was a pre-existent and immortal guardian spirit. Unlike the _urvan_, the _fravashi_ was an amoral entity, not subject to judgment. These spirits were revered in a powerful ancestor cult, where they were supplicated for aid and protection by their living descendants, functioning almost as minor family deities.

#### 3.2. The Zoroastrian Path of the Soul

Zoroaster’s eschatology is one of his most influential and detailed contributions. He taught a universal path for every soul, based entirely on the individual's ethical choices during life.

1. **The Three-Day Vigil**: For three days after death, the _urvan_ is said to linger near the body, contemplating the thoughts, words, and deeds of its past life.
2. **The Činvat Bridge**: At dawn on the fourth day, the soul journeys to the **Činvat Bridge**, the "Bridge of the Separator," where it faces judgment. The bridge is guarded by the divine judges: **Mithra**, **Sraosha**, and **Rašnu**, "the just," who holds the scales and weighs the soul's deeds.
3. **The Meeting with the** _**Daēnā**_: At the bridge, the soul is met by its _**daēnā**_, a beautiful personification of its own conscience and life's actions. For the righteous soul, the _daēnā_ appears as a lovely maiden who guides it across the wide, easy bridge into Heaven (the "House of Song"). For the wicked soul, she appears as a hideous hag who seizes it and plunges with it off the blade-thin bridge into Hell (the "House of the Lie").
4. **The Final Renovation**: This individual judgment is not the end of the story. Zoroaster's ultimate promise is a collective and cosmic salvation. At the end of time, at the **Frašō.kərǝti**, all the dead will be resurrected in the flesh. All of humanity will then face a **Last Judgment** through an ordeal of molten metal, which will seem like warm milk to the righteous but will burn away the wickedness of the sinful, purifying them. Following this final purification, Aŋra Mainyu and his demons will be utterly destroyed, Hell will be cleansed, and the entire world will be restored to its perfect state. Reunited with their perfected bodies, all of humanity will achieve an everlasting, blissful existence in the kingdom of Ahura Mazda on a renewed earth.

This comprehensive vision of judgment, resurrection, and cosmic restoration is predicated entirely on a lifetime of moral conduct, thus elevating ethics from a social necessity to the very key to personal and universal salvation.

### 4. The Ethical Imperative: From Social Order to Cosmic Struggle

While pagan Iranian ethics were firmly rooted in maintaining social contracts and the cosmic order, Zoroaster's teachings introduced a more profound and personal ethic. For Zoroaster, human action was not merely about preserving a static, divinely ordained system. Instead, it became the primary engine for the dynamic and ultimate defeat of evil. The core of his message was a call to conscious, individual moral choice, transforming every human being into a vital soldier in a universal war.

#### 4.1. The Pagan Ethos of _Aša_

The central ethical principle of the pre-Zoroastrian Iranians was _**Aša**_ (the Vedic _Ṛta_). This powerful concept encompassed multiple, interrelated ideas:

- The unchanging **cosmic order** by which the seasons turn and the sun rises.
- The **correct performance of ritual**, which was believed to strengthen the gods and maintain that cosmic order.
- **Social truthfulness and loyalty**, which ensured harmony and stability within human communities.

The paramount figure embodying this ethos was **Mithra**, the lord of the covenant. A sworn oath was not just a promise between individuals but a sacred act witnessed by a powerful god. Violating a contract was a transgression against the divine order itself, inviting divine retribution. The pagan ethical system, therefore, was primarily concerned with fulfilling one's function within a hierarchical social and cosmic structure. This is further illustrated by the veneration of amoral but functionally necessary deities like **Vərəthraghna**, the god of Victory, whose power was essential for survival but was not framed in terms of an absolute conflict between good and evil.

#### 4.2. Zoroaster's Ethic of Choice: Good Thoughts, Words, and Deeds

Zoroaster revolutionized this ethical framework by placing **free will** at the absolute center of human existence. The primary purpose of humanity is no longer simply to maintain order, but to actively and consciously choose **Aša** (Truth) over its direct opposite, **Drug** (The Lie). This choice is the defining act of a person's life and has cosmic consequences.

The practical application of this choice is encapsulated in the fundamental Zoroastrian creed: _**Humata, Hūxta, Huvarshta**_—**Good Thoughts, Good Words, and Good Deeds**. These are not merely passive virtues but the active weapons a person must wield in the spiritual battle against Aŋra Mainyu and his forces.

This ethic is directly and brilliantly connected to Zoroaster's doctrine of the Aməša Spəntas and their guardianship over the seven creations. By actively caring for the world, a person puts "Good Thoughts, Words, and Deeds" into practice and participates in the cosmic struggle.

- Tending to cattle and treating them kindly honors **Vohu Manah**.
- Working and cherishing metals so that they are useful, fair, and bright honors **Khšathra Vairya**.
- Practicing agriculture and making the earth fruitful honors **Spənta Ārmaiti**.
- Keeping water pure honors **Haurvatāt**.
- Revering fire and keeping it free from pollution honors **Aša Vahišta**.

In this way, the most fundamental activities of pastoral and agricultural life are elevated to acts of worship and spiritual warfare. A righteous life is one spent nurturing and defending Ahura Mazda's good creation, thereby pushing back the corrupting influence of Aŋra Mainyu and helping to bring about the final Renovation of the world.

### 5. Conclusion: Continuity and Transformation

The teachings of Zoroaster represent a profound re-imagining, not a complete replacement, of the ancient Iranian religion. The prophet was a revolutionary reformer who took the foundational elements of his ancestral faith—its pantheon, its cosmology, its reverence for cosmic order—and recast them into a cohesive, ethically potent, and universally resonant theological system.

Zoroaster's key innovations can be distilled into three transformative doctrines:

1. **The establishment of a universal, ethical dualism** under a supreme, wholly benevolent God, Ahura Mazda. He replaced a complex pantheon with a stark choice between the forces of Truth (Aša) and the Lie (Drug), making this moral decision the central purpose of human existence.
2. **The moralization of the physical world** through the doctrine of the Aməša Spəntas. By linking the seven Bounteous Immortals (including Ahura Mazda) to the seven creations, he imbued the material world with sacred purpose, transforming everyday acts of husbandry and care into weapons in the cosmic war against evil.
3. **The creation of a systematic and universal eschatology**. He replaced vague and stratified beliefs about the afterlife with a clear path of judgment for every individual soul, based on ethical merit, and offered the ultimate hope of bodily resurrection and a perfected, everlasting life for all of humanity in a renewed world.

In achieving this transformation, Zoroaster built upon the pagan reverence for _asa_, elevating it from a principle of static order to the banner of a dynamic struggle for good. He re-purposed the veneration of deities like Mithra, subordinating them as _Yazatas_ within a new monotheistic framework. And he adopted the existing cosmological structure, redefining it as the battleground where humanity's choices would ultimately determine the fate of existence. By building on these deep-rooted traditions, Zoroaster forged a faith of remarkable power and resilience, one whose core ideas about dualism, judgment, and final salvation would profoundly influence the course of subsequent world religions.

## From Pagan Steppe to Prophetic Vision: Tracing the Evolution of Zoroastrianism from its Indo-Iranian Roots

### **Abstract**

Zoroastrianism, one of the world's oldest revealed religions, is often mischaracterized as a sudden and radical break from its ancient past. This article argues, however, that the faith is more accurately understood as a profound prophetic reformation of a shared Indo-Iranian religious tradition. By comparing the Iranian Avesta with the Indian Rigveda, we can reconstruct the pagan foundation upon which the prophet Zoroaster built his new vision. This evolution begins with the common worship of two classes of divinities, the ethical _Asuras_ and the nature-oriented _Daevas_, alongside deeply ingrained cults of fire and the sacred plant _haoma_. Zoroaster's revelation radically reordered this worldview by introducing a cosmic ethical dualism, pitting the one uncreated God, Ahura Mazda, against a hostile spirit, Angra Mainyu. He reinterpreted the major divinities as the Amesha Spentas, or "Bounteous Immortals," linking them directly to the seven creations of the material world and thereby sacralizing physical existence as the primary battleground against evil. This reformation established a new eschatology of linear time, individual judgment, and a final renovation of the world. The faith continued to evolve historically, becoming the state religion of the Achaemenian Empire and later giving rise to the Zurvanite heterodoxy, which sought to resolve the starkness of its dualism by postulating Time as the ultimate first principle. This analysis traces Zoroastrianism not as an isolated phenomenon, but as the culmination of a long, dynamic religious development.

### **1.0 Introduction: Re-evaluating an Ancient Faith**

Early Western scholarship, shaped by a Protestant intellectual heritage, often interpreted Zoroastrianism as a purely rational and ethical monotheism that had emerged in stark opposition to pagan ritualism. Influential pioneers like Martin Haug saw the prophet Zoroaster as a figure who had rejected all forms of sacrifice and worship, save for prayer, preaching a doctrine stricter even than that of the Hebrew prophets. This perspective, while highlighting the faith's profound ethical dimension, largely overlooks its deep and continuous roots in a shared Indo-Iranian heritage. It created an artificial divide between the prophet's "pure" message and the living tradition of his followers, which was often dismissed as a later corruption.

This article seeks to correct this view by tracing the development of Zoroastrianism not as a sudden invention, but as a dynamic evolution of religious concepts, deities, rituals, and cosmology. Its objective is to demonstrate the continuity between the common pagan background of the Iranian and Indian peoples and the revolutionary message of Zoroaster, and to follow the faith's subsequent historical manifestations. We will begin by examining the pagan foundation, comparing the Iranian Avesta with the Indian Rigveda to reconstruct the shared pantheon and ritual practices. From there, we will analyze the core of the prophet's teachings—his radical ethical dualism, the doctrine of the Amesha Spentas, and his structured eschatology. Finally, we will trace the faith's historical development under the Achaemenian Empire and explore the theological challenge posed by the Zurvanite heterodoxy. To truly appreciate the scale and nature of Zoroaster's reformation, it is first necessary to understand the complex religious landscape from which it arose.

### **2.0 The Shared Indo-Iranian Heritage: The Pagan Foundation**

A strategic analysis of the pre-Zoroastrian, pagan religion of the Indo-Iranian peoples is indispensable for understanding the faith's origins. By carefully comparing the most ancient layers of the Iranian Avesta with the hymns of the Indian Rigveda, we can identify a common spiritual inheritance that predates the separation of these two peoples. This shared background—its gods, its rituals, and its vision of the cosmos—provides the essential context for appreciating both the elements Zoroaster retained and the revolutionary changes he introduced. It is within this ancient framework of belief and practice that the prophet's message finds its true meaning. The starting point for this reconstruction is the divine beings worshipped by these nomadic peoples of the steppes.

#### **2.1 The Pantheon: Asuras and Daevas**

The Indo-Iranian gods were broadly divided into two major classes: the _Asuras_ and the _Daevas_. This distinction, which would become central to Zoroaster's reformation, was already present in the pagan period. The _Asuras_ (Avestan: _Ahuras_) were high gods who personified abstract ethical and social concepts, representing order and moral authority. The _Daevas_ (Avestan: _Daēvas_), by contrast, were more closely associated with the forces of the natural world and the martial prowess so vital to a warrior society.

Three great _Asuras_ appear to have formed the core of the Indo-Iranian pantheon:

- **Mitra/Mithra:** The personification of 'covenant' or 'contract'. He was not merely the concept of a pact, but the divine power immanent within it, a sacred force that ensured undertakings were honored and punished those who transgressed them.
- **Varuna:** The supreme guardian of _ṛta_ (Vedic) or _aša_ (Avestan), a concept representing order in its widest sense: cosmic order, governing the seasons and the stars; the order of sacrifice, ensuring the efficacy of ritual; and social order, by which men could live together justly. While the name Varuna is absent in the Avesta, scholarly consensus identifies him with the pagan Iranian deity known by the cultic name _Apam Napat_, "Son of the Waters," whose original proper name was likely _Vouruna_. It is widely argued that this figure, like his Vedic counterpart, was a creator god and a powerful upholder of cosmic law.
- **The "Unnamed" Asura:** Vedic texts refer to a supreme Asura, addressed as "Our Father, the Asura," who appears to stand above even Mitra and Varuna. In Iran, this high god came to be known as **Ahura Mazda**, "the Wise Lord." The name _Mazda_ is not a traditional divine name but is derived from the divinization of the abstract concept of wisdom (_mazdā-_), a process entirely in keeping with the nature of the Asuras.

In stark contrast to these ethical lords were the _Daevas_. Chief among them in the Vedic pantheon was Indra, a swashbuckling, amoral warrior god who fought with brute force, provoked strife, and delighted in the intoxicating _soma_ drink. His character stood in direct opposition to the principles of order and justice embodied by the Asuras. It was this class of gods that Zoroaster would later utterly reject, demonizing them as the forces of wickedness and deceit.

#### **2.2 Ritual and Worship**

Pagan Indo-Iranian worship was shaped by the nomadic life of the steppes. Lacking fixed temples or religious imagery, their rituals were individualistic and performed in the open air. Ceremonies were invariably conducted at the command of a single person, the _yajamana_ ("the one who ordained the sacrifice"), who would recompense the priest for his services.

Three cultic practices formed the core of their worship:

1. **Sacrifice (**_**Yasna**_**):** The central act of worship was the _yasna_, or sacrifice. Its purpose was not merely to appease the gods but to strengthen them, thereby helping to maintain the cosmic order (_aša_). The most potent form was the blood sacrifice, typically of a bull, whose death was seen as a profoundly creative act that renewed life, echoing the cosmogonic myth of the Uniquely-created Bull. Offerings (_zaothra_), particularly of animal fat, were made to the sacred fire to nourish it.
2. **The Fire Cult:** Fire, known as _Atar_ in Iran and _Agni_ in India, was a central element of the cult. The hearth fire was especially sacred, serving as the ritual heart of the home and a conduit for offerings to the divine world.
3. **The Haoma/Soma Cult:** This ritual involved the ceremonial pounding and consumption of a sacred plant, _haoma_ (Iran) or _soma_ (India). The intoxicating juice was prepared by priests and offered to the gods, bestowing strength, inspiration, and visionary insight upon both the divine recipients and the human participants.

#### **2.3 Cosmology and Eschatology**

The Indo-Iranians held complex beliefs about the soul and the afterlife. They conceived of a dual soul: the _urvan_, which was the spirit of the individual that departed at death, and the _fravasi_, a pre-existent and immortal guardian spirit that existed for every person. Though originally distinct concepts, the two became partially fused over time, with the powerful _fravasis_ of the righteous dead becoming objects of veneration themselves.

Beliefs concerning the afterlife were similarly layered. An ancient and popular tradition held that the souls of the dead descended to a subterranean kingdom ruled by the first mortal, Yima (Iran) or Yama (India). However, a later and more aristocratic hope emerged for a paradise in heaven, a blissful abode reserved for righteous princes, priests, and warriors. After death, the _urvan_ was thought to linger on earth for three days, protected by prayers and rituals, before undertaking its final journey to one of these destinations. This intricate tapestry of deities, rituals, and eschatological hopes formed the religious world into which Zoroaster was born and against which he would launch his radical reformation.

### **3.0 The Reformation of Zoroaster: A New Vision**

Zoroaster's teachings represent one of the most profound reformations in the history of religion. His message was not a creation _ex nihilo_, but an inspired and radical re-ordering of the existing Indo-Iranian religious framework. At its heart was a powerful vision of cosmic ethical dualism, which reframed the universe as a battlefield between two opposing moral forces. This vision transformed the ancient pantheon, redefined the meaning of ritual, and established a new understanding of human purpose and destiny. The core doctrine that defines his message is the choice made by two primal spirits at the dawn of time.

#### **3.1 The Doctrine of Two Primal Spirits**

The central tenet of Zoroaster's Gathas—his sacred hymns—is the existence of two primal, uncreated Spirits (_Mainyu_) who existed at the very beginning. As he proclaimed in his revelation:

"Truly there are two primal Spirits, twins renowned to be in conflict. In thought and word, in act they are two: the better and the bad... And then when these two spirits first met, they created both life and not-life, and that there should be at the last the worst existence for the followers of the Drug, but, for the followers of Aša, the best dwelling." (Yasna 30.3-4)

Zoroaster's revelation is that Ahura Mazda is the one uncreated, wholly good God. Ontologically separate from him is Angra Mainyu, the Hostile Spirit. Ahura Mazda is not a 'twin' to Angra Mainyu; rather, He operates in the world through His own Bounteous Spirit, Spenta Mainyu, who _is_ the twin of Angra Mainyu and who made the primordial choice for _Aša_ (Truth) while his brother chose the _Drug_ (Lie). This fundamental choice brought "life and not-life" into being and established the moral and cosmic conflict that defines all of existence. This dualism is not metaphysical but ethical, setting the stage for a cosmic struggle that will continue until the final renovation of the world.

#### **3.2 The Amesha Spentas and the Seven Creations**

Zoroaster's revelation identified seven great divinities, the **Amesha Spentas** ("Bounteous Immortals"), as the primary emanations of Ahura Mazda. These are Ahura Mazda himself (as the first and greatest), and six beings who personify the highest ethical ideals of the faith.

The prophet's most critical theological innovation was to link each of these seven Amesha Spentas to one of the seven physical creations, establishing a direct and unbreakable bond between the spiritual and material realms. This doctrine had profound ethical implications, for it sacralized the entire physical world, making it the battleground against evil.

| Amesha Spenta (Personification)           | Creation (Guardianship) |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Ahura Mazda** (Wise Lord)               | Mankind                 |
| **Vohu Manah** (Good Purpose)             | Cattle                  |
| **Asha Vahishta** (Best Righteousness)    | Fire                    |
| **Khshathra Vairya** (Desirable Dominion) | The Sky / Metals        |
| **Spenta Armaiti** (Holy Devotion)        | The Earth               |
| **Haurvatat** (Wholeness/Health)          | Water                   |
| **Ameretat** (Long Life/Immortality)      | Plants                  |

This system explicitly stated that by linking abstract virtues to tangible creations, Zoroaster transformed mundane labor into sacred, soteriological acts. Metals, for instance, were believed to have been formed within the stone of the sky and thus fell under the guardianship of Khshathra Vairya. To care for cattle was to honor Vohu Manah. To tend the fire with pure offerings was to serve Asha Vahishta. To mine and work metals was to bring forth the Desirable Dominion of Khshathra Vairya. To farm the earth with diligence was to express devotion to Spenta Armaiti. Caring for the world was no longer just practical; it was humanity's primary weapon in the war against Angra Mainyu.

#### **3.3 Eschatology: The Three Times and the Final Judgment**

Zoroaster replaced the cyclical and often vague eschatology of his ancestors with a powerful, linear vision of cosmic history, divided into three great "Times":

1. **Bundahishn (Creation):** The initial period when Ahura Mazda brought the world into being in a perfect spiritual, and then material, state.
2. **Gumezishn (The Mixture):** The current age, which began with Angra Mainyu's violent assault on creation. In this era, good and evil are intermingled, and humanity's primary duty is to fight on the side of good to expel evil.
3. **Frashokereti (The Renovation):** The final state of the world after the ultimate defeat of evil. At this time, the world will be restored to its original perfection, and existence will be free from death, decay, and suffering.

The fate of the individual soul was likewise given a clear and ethically rigorous structure. After death, the soul journeys for three days to the **Chinvat Bridge**. There, it is judged by a divine tribunal including Mithra and Rashnu. The soul then encounters its own _Daena_—the sum of its thoughts, words, and deeds—which appears as either a beautiful maiden (for the righteous) or a hideous hag (for the wicked). The righteous cross the bridge into the paradise of the "House of Song," while the wicked fall into the abyss of the "House of the Lie."

This individual judgment, however, is not the end. At the Frashokereti, a final Saviour figure, the _Saoshyant_, will appear. All the dead will be resurrected, and all of humanity will pass through a final, universal ordeal by molten metal. For the righteous, it will feel like a bath in warm milk, but for the wicked, it will be an agonizing purification. This event will cleanse the world of all remaining evil and restore it to its perfect state, uniting the spiritual and material realms in everlasting bliss under Ahura Mazda. In this way, Zoroaster transformed the indistinct afterlife beliefs of his pagan heritage into a structured, ethically demanding eschatology that placed profound responsibility on every human being.

### **4.0 Historical Development and Theological Diversification**

Following the prophet's life, Zoroastrianism did not remain a static set of doctrines confined to its eastern Iranian homeland. As the faith spread, it evolved, encountering new cultures and facing internal theological pressures that prompted further development and diversification. This was particularly true as it moved westward, becoming the state religion of the mighty Achaemenian Empire and giving rise to the significant theological challenge of Zurvanism. The first major phase of this expansion involved its adoption by the priestly class of the Medes.

#### **4.1 The Faith in Western Iran and the Achaemenian Empire**

As Zoroastrianism spread into western Iran, it was adopted and propagated by the **Magi**, the powerful hereditary priestly class of the Medes. These priests became the primary custodians and transmitters of the faith, which soon gained the adherence of the Persian Achaemenian dynasty. The religious proclamations of the Achaemenian kings, especially those of Darius the Great, are deeply imbued with Zoroastrian principles. In his famous Behistun inscription, Darius repeatedly gives thanks to **Ahuramazda**, attributing all his successes to the god's will. He frames his struggle against usurpers as a righteous battle against the **"Lie"** (_Drauga_), the Zoroastrian concept of cosmic evil and disorder, declaring, "On this account Ahuramazda bore me aid... because I was not hostile, I was not a Lie-follower, I was not a doer of wrong."

A point of frequent scholarly debate is the absence of Zoroaster's own name in the royal inscriptions. This omission, however, does not necessarily indicate a lack of true conversion. It may reflect the influence of Near Eastern scribal conventions, which provided no model for a king to name a prophet in an official proclamation. Furthermore, it is argued that the priests likely did not press for the prophet's inclusion because the entire practice of writing itself was considered an alien and profane medium for holy matters. For them, sacred tradition was properly transmitted orally, not inscribed in stone. Archaeological evidence, such as the stone fire holders found at Pasargadae and the iconography of the royal tombs at Naqsh-i Rustam, further aligns Achaemenian religious practice with a Zoroastrian framework of worship.

#### **4.2 The Zurvanite Dilemma: A Heretical Solution to Dualism**

The stark dualism of Zoroaster's teaching—the existence of two co-eternal, uncreated principles of good and evil—posed a difficult theological question for later thinkers: If Ohrmazd (Ahura Mazda) and Ahriman (Angra Mainyu) are both primal, where did they come from? The Zurvanite movement arose as a heterodox attempt to solve this dilemma.

The Zurvanite solution was to postulate a single, ultimate first principle that preceded both spirits: **Zurvan**, or Infinite Time. According to the Zurvanite creation myth, preserved for us by non-Zoroastrian sources like the Armenian writer Eznik of Kolb, Zurvan existed alone in the beginning. Desiring a son, he offered sacrifice for a thousand years. Near the end of this period, he experienced a moment of doubt, questioning the efficacy of his sacrifice. From this single act, two beings were conceived in the womb of the void: Ohrmazd, the product of the sacrifice, and Ahriman, the product of the doubt. Ahriman, being conceived of doubt, tore his way out of the womb first. Bound by a vow to grant dominion to whichever son appeared first, Zurvan was forced to grant Ahriman kingship over the world for a limited period.

Zurvanism thus represented a re-introduction of monism into the religion, framing Ohrmazd and Ahriman as twin brothers born of a single progenitor. This had profound theological consequences, emphasizing fate (_baxt_) and a deterministic cosmology that stood in contrast to the orthodox Zoroastrian focus on human free will and ethical choice. While it became an influential school of thought for a time, Zurvanism was ultimately condemned by orthodox Zoroastrians as a demon-inspired heresy and faded from prominence. It remains, however, a powerful testament to the intellectual vitality and theological tensions that characterized the developing Zoroastrian tradition.

### **5.0 Conclusion: A Legacy of Dualism and Hope**

The evolution of Zoroastrianism charts a remarkable intellectual and spiritual journey, from a nature-based pagan religion shared across the Eurasian steppes to a sophisticated ethical system founded on prophetic revelation. This transformation was not an erasure of the past but a brilliant re-imagining of it, where ancient gods were re-conceived as moral forces, primitive rituals were imbued with new ethical meaning, and vague hopes for an afterlife were forged into a doctrine of cosmic purpose and individual responsibility.

The central, defining feature that emerged from this process is the profound cosmic and moral dualism between _Aša_ (Truth, Order) and the _Drug_ (the Lie, Disorder). This conflict frames all of existence, not as a meaningless cycle, but as a linear history with a clear beginning, a challenging middle, and a triumphant end. Humanity is not a passive spectator in this cosmic drama but an essential participant, whose every thought, word, and deed contributes to the struggle on the side of Ahura Mazda and the good creation.

This powerful vision bequeathed an enduring legacy to world religion. Zoroastrianism was the first faith to articulate a comprehensive doctrine of linear history, a final judgment for all humankind, the resurrection of the body, and the coming of a universal saviour. These pioneering concepts are believed to have profoundly influenced the eschatological development of post-exilic Judaism and, through it, Christianity and Islam. Yet its most lasting contribution remains its own potent vision: that of a universe locked in a moral struggle, sustained by a profound hope for a world that will, at the end of time, be definitively purified and made perfect through the final, inevitable triumph of good.
