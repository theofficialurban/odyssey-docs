This academic text proposes the controversial theory that the **ancestral Britons and Scots** were descended from **Aryan Phoenicians** who colonized and civilized Britain, beginning as early as the Stone Age. The author supports this claim by analyzing archaeological evidence, such as **prehistoric Stone Circles** and **cup-marks**, interpreting these monuments through the lens of Hitto-Sumerian and Phoenician script and solar religious symbolism. Key themes include the diffusion of a **Higher Civilization** by this ruling Aryan race, the origin of the sophisticated **monotheistic Sun-cult** in Britain, and the link between Phoenician, Hitto-Sumerian, and early British culture, demonstrating connections in language, place names like **London (New Troy)**, religion, and the origin of figures like **Britannia** and **St. George**. Ultimately, the text seeks to establish a much earlier and more advanced pre-Roman civilization in Britain by identifying historical figures, such as **Brutus-the-Trojan** and **Part-olon**, with documented Phoenician origins.

## **The Solar Roots of Britain: _A Primer on Ancient National Symbolism_**

### 1. Introduction: Beyond the "Painted Savage" Myth

For centuries, the standard historical narrative has relegated pre-Roman Britons to the status of "painted savages"—primitive, illiterate tribes roaming the wild woods of "Old Albion" until the civilizing force of the Roman legions arrived. This narrative, however, is a veil that obscures a far more sophisticated reality.

As a student of history, you must look toward the findings of L.A. Waddell, whose research unearths a forgotten lineage. The original Britons were not aboriginal primitives but a highly civilized, literate branch of the Aryan-Phoenicians. In their "winged galleys," these pioneers arrived nearly a millennium before the Christian era—specifically in 1103 B.C. under King Brutus the Trojan—bringing with them the foundations of the English language, ordered governance, and the solar religion that still breathes through our national icons today.

| Feature             | The Conventional Narrative    | The Historical Reality (Waddell)                             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Cultural Status** | Illiterate "painted savages." | Highly civilized, literate pioneers of the Bronze Age.       |
| **Origin**          | Local aboriginal tribes.      | Aryan-Phoenicians/Hittites from Asia Minor.                  |
| **Arrival**         | Vague prehistoric migrations. | Organized colonization led by Brutus the Trojan in 1103 B.C. |
| **Governance**      | Disorganized tribal warfare.  | Ordered kingdoms and sophisticated King-Lists.               |

This rediscovered heritage is not merely a matter for the archives; it is a living history encoded in the very visual symbols we recognize as the flags and currency of our modern world.

### 2. The Newton Stone: A Bilingual Key to the Past

The primary evidence for this Phoenician origin stands in the heart of a romantic meadow in the Don Valley of Aberdeenshire. Standing as a silent witness to a forgotten kingdom is the **Newton Stone** (c. 400 B.C.). It serves as the "Rosetta Stone" of British ancestry because it bears two distinct scripts:

1. **Aryan-Phoenician:** A semi-cursive script written from left to right.
2. **Ogam:** A sacred, linear "tree-twig" script used by the early Scots and Britons.

#### The Identity of Part-olon

The monument was erected by a prince named **Part-olon**, known in the British Chronicles as the "King of the Scots." His inscription provides the "smoking gun" for our ancestry by explicitly identifying him through three specific titles that link the British Isles to the ancient civilizations of the East:

- **Phoenician (Poenig):** This identifies his racial and maritime heritage as part of the world’s first great seafaring empire.
- **Brit-on (Prat/Prwt):** This is the patronymic title of his ruling clan, the **Barats**, from which the name "Britain" is derived.
- **Scot (Kazzi/Qass):** This identifies him with the "Cassi" or "Khatti" (Hittite) ruling tribes. To Waddell, "Hittite" and "Phoenician" were racially synonymous titles for this same Aryan stock.

By identifying as a Phoenician from Cilicia who is also a "Brit-on" and a "Scot," Part-olon provides the genealogical bridge between Mesopotamia and Britain. This monument commemorates his devotion to the Father-god Bel, the central figure of the ancient British faith.

### 3. The Father-God Bel and the Sacred Sun-Cross

The religious ideology of the ancient Britons was a sophisticated "Sun-worship" inherited from the Hittites (Khatti/Catti). However, we must correct a common misunderstanding: the Sun was not worshipped as a physical object, but as the symbol for the **One Universal God**, the **Father-God Bel** (also known as Indara).

The most vital emblem of this faith was the **Sun-Cross** or **Swastika**. Long before its modern political corruption, this was the "Universal Divine Victory" emblem of the ancient Barats. It eventually evolved into the "wheeled" Celtic cross and the "True Cross" of Christianity.

#### The Three Attributes of the Sun-Cross

1. **Light of the World:** Representing the illumination of the human intellect and divine guidance.
2. **The Fire-Offering:** A reference to the sacred **"Bel-fire"** rites and the production of **"Need-fire"** by friction, a practice that survived in Britain for centuries.
3. **Divine Victory:** An emblem of the Father-God’s triumph over the powers of chaos and darkness.

As these sacred standards were carried across the seas by Phoenician mariners, they became the literal templates for the flags of the British Isles.

### 4. The Union Jack: A Synthesis of Ancient Standards

The Union Jack is not a mere medieval invention; its three crosses are ancient Hitto-Phoenician sacred standards used as talismans of victory centuries before the Roman occupation.

| Saint's Name    | Ancient Hitto-Phoenician Prototype                  | Original Solar Meaning                                                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **St. George**  | The "Red Cross" of the Sun-cult in Cappadocia.      | The Sun’s protective fire and victory over the "Dragon" of darkness.     |
| **St. Andrew**  | The X-Cross or **"Indara’s Bolt"** (Thor's Hammer). | The divine weapon of the Father-God used to subdue the Serpent of Chaos. |
| **St. Patrick** | The Phoenician standard of the "Barats."            | A variation of the solar victory cross used in ancient Erin (Ireland).   |

The historical continuity of these symbols is proven by their appearance on pre-Roman **"Catti"** and **"Cassi"** coins. These coins, minted by Briton kings long before Caesar’s arrival, show that these crosses were indigenous to the British ruling class well before they were associated with Christian saints.

### 5. Britannia: The Evolution of the Sea-Queen

While the Sun-Cross represents the male aspect of divine protection, a female figure emerged to protect the waves: **Britannia**. Evidence from Phoenician coinage reveals that modern Britannia is the ancient Phoenician tutelary goddess **Barati** (known in Egypt as **Bairthy**, the "Mother of the Waters").

#### Key Features of the Barati-Britannia Connection

- **Marine Protectress:** As the "Lady of the Waters," Barati was the patroness of the "winged galleys." For a seafaring nation, this figure represents the primary benefit of maritime supremacy and the protection of global trade.
- **The Shield with Sun-Cross:** Barati is frequently depicted seated with a shield featuring the Sun-Cross—the direct prototype of the Union Jack shield held by Britannia today.
- **The Cornucopia (Horn of Plenty):** This represents the industrial and agricultural prosperity that the Aryan-Phoenicians brought to their colonies, signifying the material wealth that forms the backbone of an empire.

### 6. Conclusion: The "So What?" of the Barat Legacy

Understanding these symbols reveals that modern British identity is not a Roman or medieval byproduct, but a continuous thread of civilization linking the modern Briton to the seafaring "Barats" of the ancient world. When you look upon the Union Jack, do not see a mere flag; see a talisman of ancient Hitto-Sumerian victory that has survived for over 3,000 years.

We are the inheritors of a global civilization that refused to stay within the confines of the Mediterranean. By reclaiming these symbols, we restore the Briton to his rightful place as a descendant of the world's first great pioneers.

The names we use today are linguistic fossils. The term **"Brit-on"** is derived from the Phoenician tribal title **"Barat."** The name **"Brit-ain"** is a combination of **"Barat"** and the Sumerian suffix **"ana"** (meaning "land" or "one"), literally translating to **"The Land of the Barats."** We are a living legacy of the Barat civilization—a continuous thread of ordered, progressive humanity.

## **From Asia Minor to Albion: _The Epic Voyage of the Phoenician Mariners_**

### 1. The Hidden Ancestry: Who Were the Phoenicians?

To understand the bedrock of British identity, we must first dismantle a persistent historical myth. Traditional textbooks often classify the Phoenicians as a Semitic people, yet the archaeological and linguistic record—expertly synthesized by L.A. Waddell—reveals them as the **Aryan Khatti** (Hittites) or **"Catti."** These were not the dark-haired desert dwellers of popular imagination, but a fair, long-headed race of "Blond Long-heads" whose civilization in Mesopotamia dates back as far as **3100 B.C.**

Physically, these pioneer mariners appeared in ancient rock-sculptures wearing "Gothic" dress: conical caps, tunics, and distinctive snow-boots with turned-up toes.

**The "Aha!" Moment: Mountain Origins** For the student of history, those "turned-up toes" are a smoking gun. This footwear was designed specifically for traversing the snowy peaks of the Taurus Mountains in Asia Minor. It proves that the Phoenicians were mountain-bred Aryans who brought their high-altitude engineering and spirit of adventure down to the coast, transforming from mountaineers into the world's first supreme navigators.

**Key Insight: The Literacy of "Savages"** It is a common misconception that early Britons were primitive, "painted savages." The source context reveals that these Phoenician-Britons were a literate, organized race who brought a fully-fledged civilization—including structured law, commercial maritime prowess, and sacred scripts—to the British Isles over a millennium before the Roman occupation.

As masters of the rugged terrain of Asia Minor, their ambition and spiritual mandate eventually turned toward the horizon, launching their "winged galleys" into the Mediterranean in search of the "Sun-Fire."

### 2. The Cradle of the Mariners: Cilicia and the Sun-Cult

The ancestral heart of the Phoenician Britons was the province of **Cilicia**, in south-eastern Asia Minor. Here, in cities like Tarsus and Kastabala, they developed the twin pillars of their expansion: a sophisticated trade in metals (specifically **tin**) and the propagation of the **"Sun-cult"**—the worship of the Father-god Bil (or Bel).

| Ancestral Site    | Primary Historical Function                              | Sun-Cult / Deity Connection                       |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cilicia**       | Primary maritime province; the "Land of the Fire-Drill." | Homeland of the Tutelar of the Waters, Barati.    |
| **Tarsus (Tarz)** | Major seaport; gateway for "winged galleys" and trade.   | Seat of Sun-worship and the Father-god Bil (Bel). |
| **Kastabala**     | Sacred capital and religious hub.                        | Center for the solar cult and the goddess Barati. |
| **Boghaz Koi**    | Ancient Khatti (Hittite) capital.                        | Original source of Aryan Sun-Fire culture.        |

Having established these stationary bastions of culture, the Khatti mariners looked Westward, driven by a sacred duty to follow the path of the Sun across the Great Sea.

### 3. The Journey West: Pillars of Hercules to the North Atlantic

The migration to the British Isles was a series of calculated waves led by heroic figures. The most prominent was **King Brutus-the-Trojan** (c. 1103 B.C.), followed centuries later by the sea-king **Part-olon** (c. 400 B.C.). They utilized Spain as a primary staging ground, specifically the port of **Gades** (Cadiz), before venturing into the stormy North Atlantic.

#### **The Four Stages of the Great Migration**

1. **Departure from Cilicia:** Launching from ports like Tarsus with fleets of "winged galleys" carrying families, livestock, and sacred Fire.
2. **Staging in Spain (Gades/Cadiz):** Establishing the "House of the Gads" (Gades) as a defensive mercantile seaport outside the Mediterranean.
3. **The Northern Circuit:** Navigating the "Pillars of Hercules" and sailing around the Orkney Islands to reach the northern coasts of "Albion."
4. **Colonization of the Isles:** Formal establishment of settlements in Scotland, Ireland, and England, seeking "a small part of Britain to dwell in."

As these mariners stepped onto the rugged shores of Caledonia, they didn't see a foreign land, but a canvas upon which to mirror their lost Cilicia—transforming alien rivers into familiar echoes of their past.

### 4. Naming the New World: Geography as a Mirror of the Past

Linguistic evidence provides the "smoking gun" of Phoenician penetration into Britain. By renaming landmarks, the settlers ensured they never truly "left" home, embedding their tribal titles and religious symbols into the very soil of Albion.

#### **Toponymy Spotlight**

- **Gadie Rivulet (Aberdeenshire):** Derived from the **"Gadi"** or **"Gad"** tribal title, a common variant of the Phoenician **Khatti**.
- **Bennachie Range:** This name preserves the **"Poenig"** or **"Phoenix"** title, but it goes deeper—it is a monument to the **Phoenix Sun-Bird**, the bird emblem of the Sun-god Bil.
- **Selsey (Sussex):** A literal reflection of **"Cilicia,"** marking the "Island of the Sels" (Cilicians).
- **Caithness:** Originally **"Kata-ness,"** meaning the "Nose of the Land of the **Catti** (Hittites)."
- **Dun-Barton:** Literally the "Fort of the **Bartons**"—the Barats or Britons who established this stronghold on the Clyde.

While the names claimed the land, the physical monuments they carved provided an even more permanent record of their presence.

### 5. The Silent Witnesses: Sun-Crosses and the Stone Circles

The most compelling "first-hand notices of Britannia" are the ancient monuments left by these mariners, such as the **Newton Stone**. This stone is a pedagogical treasure, featuring a bilingual script (Aryan Phoenician and Ogam) and the **Sun-Cross**.

The **Ogam** script, often misunderstood as a primitive "Celtic" invention, is actually a "Tree-twig" script. Its branched strokes symbolize the crossed sticks used by the Aryan Sun-priests to produce the sacred "Need-Fire" via friction. This script allows us to hear the voice of the dedicator, **Part-olon**, a "Kazzi" (Cassi) king.

**The "Aha!" Moment: The Cassi Connection** The title "Kazzi" or **"Cassi"** on the Newton Stone is the direct ancestor of the name **Cassivellaunus**, the famous Briton king who resisted Julius Caesar. This linguistic bridge connects the Babylonian Kassi (who ploughed under the Sign of the Cross in 1350 B.C.) directly to the royal houses of pre-Roman Britain.

**Deciphered Message of the Newton Stone** "This Sun-Cross was raised to Bil (the God of Sun-Fire) by the Kassi... of Kast... the Phoenician named Ikar of Cilicia, the Prut (Barat/Brit-on), raised it."

These monuments demonstrate that the Early Britons used the Cross not as a Christian symbol, but as an Aryan Phoenician emblem of "Universal Divine Victory" centuries before the Roman era.

### 6. Conclusion: The Living Legacy of the Barats

The epic voyage from Asia Minor to Albion created a legacy that remains the bedrock of British identity. The tribal title **"Barat"** evolved into **"Brit-on"** and **"Brit-ain,"** while the Phoenician tutelary goddess **Barati**—the **"Tutelar of the Waters"**—was transformed into the iconic **Britannia**.

This legacy is visible even today in the national flag. The **St. George's Cross** and the **Union Jack** have their roots in the sacred Sun-Crosses carried on the shields of the Barats. The shield of Britannia is not merely a modern design; it is the ancient solar shield of Barati, brought from the shores of Cilicia to the cliffs of Dover. The maritime supremacy and adventurous spirit of modern Britain are the direct inheritance of these Asia Minor pioneers.

#### **Student Reflection**

1. **Civilization over Savagery:** The original Britons were literate, seafaring Aryans from the Hittite/Phoenician stock, arriving with a sophisticated culture over a millennium before Rome.
2. **The Solar Blueprint:** Modern national symbols—Britannia, the Union Jack, and the St. George’s Cross—are ancient Aryan Phoenician emblems of the Sun-Fire.
3. **Linguistic Footprints:** Geography is a living history book; names like Caithness, Selsey, and Dun-Barton are permanent records of the "Barat" migration path.

## **The Phoenician-Aryan Nexus: _A Philological Re-evaluation of British Etymology and Migration_**

### 1. Introduction: The Revisionist Philology of L.A. Waddell

The prevailing historiographical consensus, which treats British civilization as a mere byproduct of the Roman provincial machine, represents a profound failure of philological and archaeological synthesis. It is the strategic imperative of this monograph to re-examine the origins of the British Isles not as a terminal outpost of the Caesars, but as the deliberate, ancient colonization by the Aryan-Phoenician race. By dismantling the "painted savage" myth—a reductionist fabrication of later Roman observers—we can reconstruct a timeline where the grounding of Phoenician galley keels on Albion’s shores introduced the higher culture of the Levant nearly a millennium before the first legionary landed.

The central thesis presented herein is that the contemporary "Britons" and "Scots" are the direct lineal and racial descendants of the Aryan "Barat" and "Khatti" (Hittite) tribes of Asia Minor and Syria-Phoenicia. This migration represents a cohesive movement of a literate, maritime aristocracy that transplanted its entire cultural apparatus—language, religious symbolism, and tribal nomenclature—from the Anatolian heartland to the British North. The primary evidentiary anchor for this re-evaluation is the Newton Stone, a bilingual monument that provides a definitive, contemporary notice of Britannia centuries before the Roman era.

### 2. The Newton Stone: A Bi-lingual Key to Pre-Roman Britain

The Newton Stone, an irregular quartzose gneiss pillar in the Don Valley of Aberdeenshire, serves as a first-hand notice of Britannia dating to approximately 400 B.C. As a bi-lingual artifact, it offers a dual-script record of the migration of the Aryan-Phoenicians, providing a contemporaneous verification of the British Chronicles (Geoffrey of Monmouth and Nennius) that modern historians have too hastily dismissed. The author of the inscription, King Part-olon, records his specific lineage and titles, bridging the gap between the Eastern Mediterranean and the Scottish Highlands.

The primary script is a semi-cursive Aryan-Phoenician, while the secondary inscription is the Ogam linear script. The decipherment reveals a sophisticated record of origin, as illustrated in the following table:

| Script Component  | Transliteration                   | Philological & Geographic Significance                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Personal Name** | **Ikar (Ixar)**                   | Corresponds to the "Western Land" (_Akharri_) of the Amorites; a marker of westward Kassi/Hittite migration.                                           |
| **Origin Point**  | **Cilicia (Sssilokoy/Siollagga)** | The maritime seat of Sun-worship in Asia Minor; the strategic bridge from the Levant to the Don Valley.                                                |
| **Tribal Title**  | **Kazzi (Qass)**                  | Uses the "Z" form found in Northwest Semitic (e.g., _Zidon_ for _Sidon_), latterly softening into the British "Cassi/Catti" via dental-sibilant shift. |
| **Ethnic Marker** | **Prat / Prwt**                   | Dialectical variant of "Barat" or "Brihat," the foundational root of "Brit-on" and "Brit-ain."                                                         |

By assuming the titles of "Phoenician," "Briton," and "Scot," King Part-olon effectively dismantles the arbitrary jettisoning of early British history. He identifies himself as a native of Kastabala in Cilicia, proving that the ruling elite of Britain were not aboriginal Picts, but an aristocratic, "hall-dwelling" class of Aryan mariners who brought the Khatti civilization to the shores of Albion.

### 3. Etymological Transformation: From Barat and Khatti to Briton and Catti

The persistence of tribal markers across millennia serves as the most rigorous proof of ethnic continuity. The transition of the title "Barat" (Vedic _Brihat_) into "Brit-on" is a structural evolution underpinned by the Sumerian linguistic substrate.

- **The** _**Ana**_ **Suffix:** The formation of "Brit-on" relies on the Sumerian suffix _-ana_, meaning "one" or "individual." The compound "Barat-ana" (One of the Barats) is the linguistic fossil preserved in the Scottish "ane" and the Roman "Brit-anni." This is an aggressive marker of ethnic identity, parallel to "Rajput-ana."
- **The Khatti-Catti Equation:** The ruling "Khatti" of Asia Minor and Syria-Phoenicia are the direct progenitors of the "Catti" kings of pre-Roman Britain.
- **Vedic Nuance:** It is critical to note that the early Pali form _Khattiyo_ is the pure Hittite ethnic marker; the later Sanskrit _Kshatriya_ contains an intrusive "r," representing a secondary Sanskritization of the original Aryan root.

| Ancient Hittite (Xatti/Khatti)         | Vedic/Pali (Khattiyo)                             | Pre-Roman British (Catti/Cassi)                 | Modern Scottish (Scot/Xat)            |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| The ruling race of Cappadocia/Cilicia. | The "noble" caste (Intrusive 'r' in _Kshatriya_). | Title stamped on British coinage (_Cas_ coins). | Dialectic survival of the _Xat_ root. |

The "Cassi" title, found on both Babylonian seals and British coinage, establishes a unilateral cultural transfer of Sun-Cross worship. This was not an independent invention but the deliberate export of a Solar-maritime cult, cemented by the arrival of King Brutus and later King Part-olon.

### 4. Linguistic Concordance: Sumerian Roots in English and Doric Dialects

A philological audit reveals that approximately 50% of common English words are Sumerian in origin. Furthermore, the "Doric" Scottish dialect preserves original Aryan forms with greater fidelity than the highly evolved Sanskrit or Classical Greek. This identifies the Scots as a linguistic fossil of the early migration.

The technical phonology of this transition is best observed in the dropping of initial gutturals—a process of lenition. For example, the Hittite word for a porticoed palace or hall, _Khilaani_ (or _Xilaani_), underwent a specific shift:

1. **Khilaani/Xilaani** (Hittite/Sumerian)
2. **Geleoin** (Irish-Scot clan title)
3. **Uchlani** (The "dropping of the initial guttural G" as noted in Ptolemy’s British tribal titles)
4. **Wallon** (The palatalized final form, seen in the king-title _Cad-wallon_).

This linguistic continuity distinguishes the Aryan "hall-dwellers" from the cave-dwelling aborigines. Furthermore, the conventional "Celtic" classification of the Ogam script must be challenged. Ogam is a "Sun-cult" script of the Hittites, evidenced by:

1. **Numerical Parallels:** The letter "I" consists of five perpendicular strokes in both the Ogam script and the primitive linear Sumerian signs—a "smoking gun" of unilateral transfer.
2. **Solar Patterns:** The "tree-twig" patterns represent the sacred fire-sticks used in Sun-cult rituals.

### 5. Iconographic Evidence: The Migration of the Sun-Cross and Britannia

The migration of the tutelary goddess "Barati" into the modern "Britannia" is the most visible testament to Phoenician continuity. On Lycaonian and Phoenician coins, Barati is depicted in a manner identical to the modern British penny: seated upon waves, holding the rudder or the handled Cross-sceptre—the prototype for the Red Cross of St. George.

The Sun-Cross (Swastika) serves as the common denominator between the Hittite "Khatti," the Babylonian "Cassis," and the "Catti" Britons. The presence of these symbols on pre-Christian British monuments necessitates a complete revision of the "Celtic" timeline. These are not Christian adoptions but ancient Phoenician standards of victory. The "Cassi" Sun-Cross on Babylonian seals and its subsequent appearance on British "Catti" coins proves a unilateral cultural transfer from the East to the West. This Solar-maritime cult, symbolized by the "Mother of the Waters" (Barati) and the Solar-Cross, was the unifying theological framework of the Phoenician-Aryan settlers.

### 6. Conclusion: Re-establishing the Ancient British Chronicles

The synthesis of philological, iconographic, and inscriptional evidence mandates a total rehabilitation of the chronicles of Geoffrey of Monmouth and Nennius. The accounts of King Brutus and King Part-olon, long relegated to the realm of myth, are now validated as historical fact by the Newton Stone and the "Catti" coinage.

Current Indo-European migration theories must be revised to acknowledge the Phoenician-Aryan movement as the true foundation of British civilization. There is an undeniable linguistic and racial continuity between the ancient East (Kastabala, Cilicia) and the modern West. The name "Britain" itself is a living Phoenician fossil, a testament to the "hall-dwelling" Barats who brought literacy, agriculture, and the Sun-cult to the North. The British nation remains the legitimate heir to the Phoenician-Aryan civilization, a legacy preserved in its language, its symbols, and its blood.
