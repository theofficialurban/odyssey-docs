## Overview

Webster Tarpley’s text presents a revisionist history asserting that **King Edward VII** was the primary **architect of World War I** rather than a mere figurehead. The author argues that through a sophisticated strategy of **geopolitical encirclement**, Edward personally dismantled Germany’s security by forging the **Triple Entente** and manipulating various global leaders into a hostile coalition. The narrative further explores the monarch's **clandestine influence** over British foreign policy, his extensive network of political "puppets," and even sensational theories regarding his family's involvement in the **Jack the Ripper** murders. Ultimately, the source contends that the **Versailles Treaty** unfairly blamed Germany, suggesting instead that the true **war guilt** belongs to a British conspiracy masterminded by the King to preserve imperial dominance.

   1. After the Bolshevik Revolution, most of those royals who were distantly related to the Tsar rightfully feared the same would happen to them and so were willing to spend as much money as possible to **protect themselves from the threat.**

## **King Edward VII and the Architects of Armageddon: _A Biographical Influence Summary_**

### 1. The "Evil Demiurge": King Edward VII’s Geopolitical Vision

King Edward VII was not a mere figurehead; he was the **autocrat of British foreign policy**, functioning as the absolute dictator of London’s diplomatic strategy. Operating through a private network "outside and alongside" the official government, Edward resurrected the "Venetian tradition" of geopolitics. This strategy followed a cold, brutal maxim: allying with the second-strongest continental power to destroy the strongest.

Before 1870, British hostility was directed at Russia (as evidenced by Edward’s 1875 trip to India to prepare the Afghan war). However, once Germany emerged as the preeminent land power after the Franco-Prussian War, Edward shifted his focus. His life's work became the "brutal simplicity" of encircling the German Empire with a hostile coalition, ensuring a war of annihilation that would decimate both Germany and Britain's continental "allies."

**The "Nessus Robe" Encirclement** Contemporary observers recognized Edward’s lethal diplomacy. Following his 1910 death, the _Leipziger Neuste Nachrichten_ noted: "For long years, King Edward wove, with masterly skill, the **Nessus robe** that was to destroy the German Hercules." In Greek mythology, the centaur Nessus gave Hercules’ wife a robe soaked in his own poisoned blood, a deceptive gift that eventually consumed the hero in agony. Edward’s diplomatic net of ententes was this poisoned robe—a "gift" of alliances designed to cling to and eventually incinerate the German Empire.

This personal vision of destruction required a hand-picked "Homintern" of loyalists across the military and diplomatic spheres to execute.

### 2. The Inner Circle: The British Operatives

Edward VII operated through the "Marlborough House set," a collection of rakes, bankers, and politicians who owed their careers to his patronage. This network allowed the King to manage global affairs while the official Cabinet merely followed in his wake.

| Figure                    | Personal Link to Edward VII                                                        | Strategic Contribution to War                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sir Edward Grey**       | The King’s godson; son of a royal equerry (master of the horses).                  | As Foreign Secretary, he executed a "trick" of cultivate the illusion of good relations (e.g., the 1913 Liman von Sanders affair) to ensure German complacency while secretly encouraging Russian aggression. |
| **Joseph Chamberlain**    | Member of the King's "fast set" at Marlborough House.                              | Acted as the point man for the **Entente Cordiale** and conducted a "deception operation" regarding a fake alliance with Germany to prevent a continental coalition against Britain during the Boer War.      |
| **Admiral Jackie Fisher** | A protected protégé whom Edward shielded from all political enemies.               | Introduced the **Dreadnought** and repeatedly advocated for a "preventive war," suggesting Britain should "Copenhagen" (sneak attack) the German fleet in harbor to destroy it before it could grow.          |
| **Winston Churchill**     | Protégé; son of **Lord Randolph Churchill**, the King's fellow rake and companion. | As First Lord of the Admiralty, he ordered the Grand Fleet to **Scapa Flow** on July 28, 1914—without Cabinet approval—putting the British war machine on a full footing before any other power.              |

**The Grey "Perfidy":** Sir Edward Grey’s role was the final lever. In July 1914, he ensured German disorientation by using Edward’s son, **King George V**, to lie to the Kaiser’s brother, Prince Henry, promising Britain would remain neutral. Simultaneously, Grey gave Paris and St. Petersburg the "hints" of support they needed to authorize mobilization, effectively detonating the crisis he claimed to be mediating.

### 3. The Continental Puppets: France and Russia

The King’s influence extended into the hearts of foreign governments, where he installed "pro-consuls" whose loyalty to Edward’s personal "ring" superseded their duty to their own republics or empires.

- **Georges Clemenceau ("The Tiger"):** Identified by Emile Flourens as the **"pro-consul of the English king."** Edward utilized the **Panama Scandal** and the **Dreyfus Affair** as strategic tools to wreck the Gambetta political machine and break the French Army’s institutional resistance. This cleared the path for Clemenceau to administer "the province of the Gauls" for London, sacrificing millions of French lives for _la revanche_.
- **Théophile Delcassé:** Edward’s primary tool for the **Entente Cordiale**. Delcassé acted as the King’s minister rather than France’s; when his Cabinet colleagues threatened to fire him in 1905 for his reckless aggression, Edward personally docked his yacht at Algiers to send a telegram stating he would be "personally distressed" if Delcassé left, forcing his temporary retention.
- **Alexander Izvolski:** A "dandified" Russian diplomat who entered Edward’s personal service in 1904. He orchestrated the **Buchlau Bargain**, a Balkan maneuver designed to ignite a terminal conflict between Russia and Austria. Following the 1914 outbreak, he boasted in Paris, **"C'est ma guerre!"** (It is my war!), confirming his role as an agent of Edward's influence.

These figures were essential because they ensured that France and Russia would serve as the "continental daggers" in Edward's grand design.

### 4. The Targets of Manipulation: The "Doomed Nephews"

Edward VII, the "Uncle of Europe," weaponized his **"profound knowledge of the human heart"** to psychologically dismantle his younger relatives, exploiting their defects to drive them toward ruin.

| The Target                      | The Psychological Exploitation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Kaiser Wilhelm II ("Willy")** | Edward made an "in-depth study" of Wilhelm’s feelings of inferiority and desperate desire for British acceptance. He modulated his behavior—alternating between friendly visits and public humiliations (once even knocking the Kaiser down)—to provoke Wilhelm into blunders like the **"Huns" speech**, which made Germany an international pariah. |
| **Czar Nicholas II ("Nicky")**  | Edward used Izvolski to manage Nicholas, exploiting the Czar's resentment of France (who failed to help him in the Russo-Japanese War) to pull him into the 1907 Anglo-Russian Entente. He steered Nicholas away from the Far East and into a collision course with Austria in the Balkans.                                                           |

**The Failure of Bjoerkjoe:** In 1905, the "doomed nephews" attempted a desperate revolt. Meeting at Bjoerkjoe, they signed a mutual defense treaty to escape Edward’s "nightmare world" of alliances. However, Edward’s network—specifically the "slippery" Chancellor von Buelow in Berlin and pro-British assets in St. Petersburg—sabotaged the agreement, returning the cousins to the King's control.

### 5. The "Nightmare World": From Personal Rivalry to Global Mobilization

The transition to global war was achieved through a sequence of crises that "closed the ring" around Germany, a process that continued even after the King’s death in 1910.

#### **The Sequence of the Encirclement:**

1. **Anglo-Japanese Treaty (1902):** Used Japan as an "Asian torpedo" to neutralize Russia’s fleet.
2. **Entente Cordiale (1904):** Converted France into a British-controlled dagger against Germany.
3. **1905 Russian Revolution:** A project unleashed by British intelligence assets (boyars, communists, and Zionists) to **cripple** Russia, making it militarily dependent on London.
4. **Anglo-Russian Entente (1907):** Formally completed the encirclement.
5. **1914 Sarajevo Crisis:** Triggered "crossed mobilizations" via Edward’s surviving "madmen" (Grey, Sazonov, Poincaré).

By August 1914, the Kaiser finally grasped the reality: **"Edward VII is stronger after his death than am I who am still alive!"** The net had been thrown, and London’s "Lord of the Flies" had achieved his success from the grave.

### 6. Summary of Historical Guilt and the Versailles Legacy

The Treaty of Versailles, specifically **Article 231 (the "War Guilt Clause")**, represents the "Big Lie" of the 20th century. By forcing Germany to accept sole responsibility, the Entente powers justified a "Carthaginian peace" and massive reparations designed to finish the work Edward started.

The evidence confirms that World War I was not an accidental "slide" into conflict, but a **London-centered conspiracy**. It was the product of a decades-long geopolitical project orchestrated by Edward VII through the manipulation of international alliances and the cultivation of a "Homintern" of loyal operatives.

World War I was the deliberate result of Edward VII’s "masterly skill" in weaving a hostile coalition. When examining the origins of the 20th century's carnage, we must look past the "Windsor" rebrand—the royal family’s name change during the war to hide their German roots—and recognize the dynasty for what the evidence suggests: the **"House of Jack the Ripper."** Just as Edward’s son, Prince Eddy, remains the primary suspect in the Whitechapel murders, the King himself was the homicidal architect of a "nightmare world" that shattered western civilization.

## **The Nessus Robe: _King Edward VII’s Master Plan for the Encirclement of Germany_**

### 1. The Evil Demiurge: Defining King Edward VII’s Role

The official narrative of the 20th century presents King Edward VII as a harmless, gregarious "Uncle of Europe," a ceremonial figurehead more interested in the baccarat table than the briefing room. This is a lie. The evidence exposes Edward VII as the **Evil Demiurge** of the Triple Entente—the "autocrat of British foreign policy" who operated a shadow government outside the control of the British Cabinet.

Edward was a geopolitical strategist steeped in the **Venetian tradition**. This logic is simple but brutal: London must always ally with the second strongest continental power to destroy the strongest. Until 1870, that target was Russia; after the rise of a united Germany, Edward recognized a new "Hercules" that had to be strangled. He was the "master weaver" of the alliances that would eventually slaughter millions, utilizing his personal magnetism—a weaponized "Bertiemania"—to manipulate the "Homintern" and a network of puppets across Europe.

| The Public Legend                                                                               | The Historical Reality                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A sybaritic hedonist and "royal rake" obsessed with mistresses, horse racing, and fine dining.  | The "Lord of the Flies"—a geopolitical dictator who personally constructed the ring around Germany.                     |
| A ceremonial monarch with limited political influence and an "eternal mother" (Queen Victoria). | A master of "Venetian geopolitics" who viewed nations as pawns to be sacrificed for British hegemony.                   |
| The "Peacemaker" whose state visits were intended to foster European harmony.                   | The head of the "House of Jack the Ripper," whose network of agents (the "Homintern") engineered a war of annihilation. |

**So What?** The student must understand that World War I was not an "accident" or a "slide" into chaos; it was a **premeditated personal creation**. By stripping away the mask of the "royal rake," we see the architecture of the 20th century’s first great catastrophe as a deliberate act of oligarchic will.

_While Edward possessed the vision of a destroyer, it was the humiliation of the British Empire in South Africa that provided the desperate catalyst for his plan._

### 2. The Catalyst: The Boer War and the End of "Splendid Isolation"

Between 1899 and 1902, Great Britain faced a "Cambrai moment"—a crisis of survival where, much like Venice in 1509, the world’s powers seemed poised to unite against it. The Boer War revealed that the British colossus had "feet of clay."

**The Three Critical Takeaways from the Boer War Crisis:**

1. **Imperial Vulnerability:** The "Black Week" of December 1899 saw the world’s most powerful navy and army humiliated by a few thousand Dutch-speaking farmers, signaling that the Empire was overextended and weak.
2. **Moral Depravity as a Diplomatic Liability:** The British response to their defeats—the invention of the century’s first **concentration camps** and the systematic **starvation of Afrikaner children**—ignited a global wave of anti-British hatred from the U.S. to Russia.
3. **The Threat of the "Continental League":** For the first time, France, Russia, and Germany discussed intervening against London. Britain was "isolated and friendless," facing a nightmare coalition that could dismantle its global hegemony.

**So What?** This existential dread forced the shift from "Splendid Isolation" to the strategy of encirclement. Edward VII realized that Britain could no longer stand alone; it had to own the "Asian torpedo" (Japan) and the "Continental dagger" (France) to ensure that the "Hercules" in Berlin could never form a league of its own.

_Terrified by the prospect of a united Europe, Edward launched a masterstroke of diplomatic deception to close the ring._

### 3. Threading the Needle: The Strategic Alliances (1902–1907)

The "Nessus robe"—the poisoned garment of the centaur intended to kill Hercules—was woven through three distinct treaties. These were not mere border settlements; they were the mobilization of human weapons.

| Treaty / Alliance                  | Key Asset / Agent         | Strategic Purpose for Isolating Germany                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Anglo-Japanese Alliance (1902)** | **Admiral Jackie Fisher** | Used Japan as an "Asian torpedo" to cripple Russia’s fleet, while Fisher (Edward’s protégé) simultaneously plotted to "Copenhagen" (sneak attack) the German Navy.               |
| **Entente Cordiale (1904)**        | **Georges Clemenceau**    | Trading Egypt for Morocco. Clemenceau, the "pro-consul of the English King," helped transform France from a rival into a subservient "Continental dagger" for British interests. |
| **Anglo-Russian Entente (1907)**   | **Alexander Izvolski**    | Edward personally massaged this "dandified" agent to resolve colonial disputes in Asia, focusing Russian aggression solely on Germany’s eastern border.                          |

**So What?** These treaties were the **building blocks** of a war machine. By 1907, Edward had successfully transformed the Kaiser's "nightmare of coalitions" into a geopolitical reality, ensuring that Germany would be decimated in a two-front war of attrition.

_Once the ring was closed, Edward’s network used a series of manufactured crises to ensure the target could not escape the net._

### 4. Tightening the Robe: The Moroccan and Balkan Crises

The "Nessus robe" was tightened through intentional pressure points designed to provoke German reactions and cement the dependency of Britain’s "allies."

- **The Morocco Gambit (1905, 1911):** Edward used Morocco as bait. When the Kaiser challenged French claims, it was framed as German aggression. The "smoking gun" of Edward’s personal interference occurred in 1905, when he **docked his yacht in Algiers** to personally save his puppet, Foreign Minister Delcassé, from resignation, ensuring France remained on the path to war.
- **The Balkan Crisis (1908–1909):** Through the "Buchlau Bargain"—a shady deal involving his agent Izvolski—Edward sparked tensions between Austria and Russia. This manufactured "humiliation" of Russia redirected Slavophile rage against Germany, turning the Balkans into the detonator for Europe.

**So What?** The primary benefit of these regional "dress rehearsals" was to transform abstract treaties into emotional realities. They ensured that by 1914, the "nightmare of coalitions" was no longer a fear, but a fact.

_With the regional crises having blooded the alliances, the stage was set for the final trap in the summer of 1914._

### 5. The Trigger: Sir Edward Grey’s Diplomatic Deception of 1914

Following Edward VII’s death, his protégé and "godson," Sir Edward Grey, executed the final deception. Grey, the embodiment of **Perfidious Albion**, purposefully maintained a "posture of deception" during the July Crisis.

#### **The Two Paths of War Avoidance (Rejected by Grey):**

1. **Early Warning to Germany:** Grey refused to warn Berlin that Britain would fight, which would have forced the Kaiser to restrain Austria.
2. **Warning to Russia/France:** Grey refused to tell St. Petersburg that Britain would remain neutral, which would have deflated the Russian war party.

Instead, Grey lied to his own Cabinet and the House of Commons, secretly encouraging mobilization while publicly acting as a "mediator." While history blames Germany for the first move, the British war machine was actually the first Great Power to reach a full war footing.

#### **The Order of General Mobilization (The War Machine’s Pulse):**

1. **Serbia** (July 25)
2. **Great Britain** (**Grand Fleet on full war footing**, July 28-29 - _Before any other Great Power_)
3. **Russia** (July 30-31)
4. **Austria** (July 31)
5. **France** (August 1)
6. **Germany** (August 1)

_As the "net" was thrown over him, the Kaiser finally recognized the hand of his late uncle guiding the slaughter._

### 6. Synthesis for the Learner: The Legacy of the "Nessus Robe"

The "Nessus robe" was a poisoned trap that destroyed the "German Hercules" but also decimated the wearers—France and Russia. The Versailles Treaty’s "War Guilt Clause" (Article 231) was the final "Big Lie" of the victors, designed to justify a **Carthaginian Peace** that demanded $32 billion in reparations and set the stage for the next century of horror.

"The net has been suddenly thrown over our head, and England sneeringly reaps the most brilliant success of her persistently prosecuted anti-German world policy... Edward VII is stronger after his death than am I who am still alive!" — **Kaiser Wilhelm II, August 1914**

**Final Insight** The catastrophe of 1914 was not an accident; it was an orchestrated destruction of the old European order to preserve British hegemony. By destroying the three great empires of Europe, Edward VII’s network opened the door to Communism, Fascism, and the subsequent horrors of the 20th century.

#### The 5 Lessons for the Aspiring Historian

- **The Individual as Autocrat:** History is driven by the focused will of strategic actors like Edward VII, not just impersonal social forces.
- **The Lie of Article 231:** "War Guilt" is often a propaganda tool used by the victor to mask a "Carthaginian Peace" and an economic blockade.
- **Perfidious Albion’s Playbook:** Diplomacy is frequently a deception operation where treaties of "friendship" are actually building blocks for a war of annihilation.
- **The Trap of Encirclement:** A target state, when successfully encircled by a "Nessus robe," is often forced into a tactical offensive that the world then labels as "aggression."
- **The Continuity of the Oligarchy:** The network established by Edward—the Churchills, the Greys, and the "Homintern"—continued to shape the blood-soaked century long after their master’s death.

## **Geopolitical Strategy Assessment: _The Edwardian Encirclement and the Engineering of the Great War_**

### 1. The Theoretical Framework: The Venetian Tradition and the End of Splendid Isolation

At the turn of the twentieth century, London executed a pivot of calculated desperation to avoid a "Cambrai" moment. For decades, the Victorian era had been defined by "Splendid Isolation"—a policy of detached maritime supremacy that allowed the British Empire to remain aloof from continental entanglements. However, this posture became untenable following the 1870 unification of Germany and its subsequent rise as an industrial and military Hercules. The transition from the detached Victorian policy to an aggressive, interventionist posture was not merely a reaction to shifting power dynamics, but a return to the "Venetian tradition" of geopolitics. This doctrine operates on the brutal maxim of allying with the second-strongest continental power to facilitate the total destruction of the strongest.

The strategic necessity of this pivot is best understood through the historical parallel of the War of the League of Cambrai in 1509. Just as the Venetian oligarchy faced a united front of European powers seeking to dismantle its maritime hegemony, Edward VII recognized that by 1901, the British Empire was "isolated and friendless" during the Boer War. To stave off a similar continental coalition, the King abandoned the stagnant Victorian order—characterized by the Queen’s Balmoral "death cult," where she sought occult communication with the shade of Prince Albert through mediums like John Brown—and replaced it with a kinetic, sodomist autocracy. Edward VII became the "Evil Demiurge" of a new global order, transforming Europe from a system of competing interests into a nightmare world of crossed mobilizations.

### 2. Constructing the Ring: The Diplomatic Pincers of the Triple Entente

The construction of the Triple Entente was not a series of defensive precautions, but the systematic engineering of a "close ring" around Germany—a masterly woven "Nessus robe" designed for the annihilation of a rival. Edward VII personally masterminded these diplomatic maneuvers, reconciling with former enemies to weaponize them against Berlin.

- **The Asian Torpedo: The Anglo-Japanese Alliance (1902):** Japan served as the first pincer. By socially lionizing Marquis Ito and decorating Japanese leadership, the King secured an alliance that functioned as an "Asian torpedo." The treaty’s "benevolent neutrality" clause gave Japan a free hand for the 1904 sneak attack on Port Arthur, neutralizing Russian influence in the Far East and forcing St. Petersburg back into the European theater. Even when the 1904 Dogger Bank incident—where the Russian fleet fired on British trawlers—threatened to ignite war prematurely, Edward manipulated the crisis to further isolate the Tsar.
- **The Unequal Barter: The Entente Cordiale (1904):** To secure France, Edward facilitated a trade of British control in Egypt for French preeminence in Morocco. This "unequal barter" was designed to place France on a collision course with Germany. As the revisionist Emile Flourens noted, the Dreyfus Affair was a "concocted" operation used to break French institutional resistance and install Clemenceau as the "pro-consul of the English king."
- **Closing the Circle: The Anglo-Russian Entente (1907):** The final link was forged by Edward’s agent, Alexander Izvolski. By dividing spheres of influence in Iran, Afghanistan, and Tibet, Russia was incentivized to abandon its Far Eastern ambitions and refocus its military weight on the Balkans, completing the encirclement.

**Strategic Differentiators of the Encirclement**

| Entente Partner | Primary Strategic Concession    | Intended Conflict Zone         | Key Operative/Agent |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| **Japan**       | Neutrality in Far East conflict | Port Arthur / Russian Far East | Marquis Ito         |
| **France**      | Control of Morocco              | The Rhine / Alsace-Lorraine    | Théophile Delcassé  |
| **Russia**      | Spheres in Persia/Central Asia  | The Balkans / Eastern Front    | Alexander Izvolski  |

### 3. The Marlborough House Network: Oligarchic Agents and Psychological Warfare

Edward VII, the "Homicidal Uncle of Europe," operated as a dictator of British foreign policy, utilizing an extensive shadow network of operatives and financial assets known as the "Marlborough House set."

**The Domestic Operatives and Financial Assets** The King cultivated a generation of political "clerks," including the Churchill family (Randolph and his protégé Winston) and the Chamberlains. Joseph Chamberlain acted as the point man for deceptive alliance proposals to Germany while simultaneously engineering the Boer War. Sir Edward Grey, the King’s godson, stayed in the Foreign Office to execute the King’s dictates while Edward conducted personal diplomacy. This network was underpinned by the King's personal "household finance agency," which included Sir Ernest Cassell, the Rothschilds, and the Sassoons—figures who managed the King's debts in exchange for proximity to power.

**The "Homintern" and Global Reach** The King utilized the "Homintern"—a network of influential figures such as Prince Felix Yussupov—to exert pressure in foreign courts. Yussupov, the "beautiful transvestite" who once received a mash note from the King, was the asset used to assassinate Rasputin, effectively destabilizing the Russian court’s "German agent" and detonating the 1917 revolution. This network extended to the United States; after the British-linked assassination of President McKinley, Edward manipulated Theodore Roosevelt through Cecil Spring-Rice, flattering Roosevelt as a leader of the "Anglo-Saxon race" while privately mocking him as a semi-savage.

**The Deep State and the House of Jack the Ripper** The Edwardian era was characterized by a moral climate of Masonic intrigue. The "House of Jack the Ripper" allegations involving Edward’s son, Prince Eddy, and the subsequent cover-up by Gen. Sir Charles Warren illustrate this. Warren, the master of the Quatuor Coronati Lodge founded under Edward’s warrant, suppressed evidence and intimidated witnesses to protect the monarchy, establishing the "Deep State" infrastructure required for a war-making autocracy.

### 4. The Strategy of Provocation: Triggering the Conflagration

The path to 1914 was paved with calculated traps designed to test the Entente and prepare public opinion for an "inevitable" war. Central to this was the concept of "Copenhagening"—a preventive strike to destroy a rival fleet—championed by Edward’s protégé, Admiral Jackie Fisher.

- **The Moroccan and Balkan Crises:** The 1905 Tangier and 1911 Agadir crises were traps set to inflame the French _revanche_ syndrome. Similarly, the 1908 Buchlau Bargain, orchestrated by Izvolski under the King's direction at Marienbad, was used to manufacture a Russian "humiliation" over Bosnia, turning Slavic sentiment permanently against the Central Powers.
- **The July 1914 Deception:** Sir Edward Grey executed a dual-track deception, lying to his own Cabinet and Parliament to maintain an illusion of British neutrality in Berlin. This discouraged the Kaiser from restraining Austria. Crucially, King George V provided a "word of a king" pledge of neutrality to Prince Henry, keeping the Kaiser disoriented until the Russian mobilization made war unavoidable.

**The Mobilization Sequence (Chronological)**

1. **Serbia** (July 25)
2. **Great Britain** (Grand Fleet to Scapa Flow, July 28-29)
3. **Russia** (July 30)
4. **Austria** (July 31)
5. **France** (August 1)
6. **Germany** (August 1) – _Note: Germany was the last power to activate._

### 5. The Nessus Robe: The Strategic Objective of Universal Decimation

The "Nessus robe" was intended to facilitate a war of annihilation that would leave even Britain's allies crippled. The "brutal simplicity" of the King's goal was a continental charnel house that would preserve British hegemony by universal decimation.

**The Human and Ideological Toll** The war achieved its goals with horrific efficiency. France suffered 6 million casualties, while Russia endured 9 million—a slaughter foreshadowed by the "grimmest of portents," Edward’s 1908 Reval state visit to the Tsar. This destruction opened the door to the radicalisms of the 20th century: the collapse of the old order in Russia birthed Communism, while the devastation in Central Europe fueled the rise of Fascism.

**Economic Strangulation** The strategy continued post-armistice through the "Carthaginian peace" of Versailles. Germany was burdened with a $32 billion reparations debt and a continuing naval blockade, a final act of the "Nessus" strategy that directly precipitated the Great Depression and ensured the total prostration of the European continent.

### 6. Geopolitical Conclusion: The Revision of War Guilt

The central argument of this assessment is that World War I was a premeditated "international conspiracy" masterminded by the British monarchy. The Triple Entente was never a defensive alliance; it was a mechanism for encirclement and the engineering of a general war.

**Challenging the "Big Lie"** Article 231 of the Versailles Treaty—the War Guilt Clause—is a "patent absurdity" and a "Big Lie." The 1919 Commission on the Responsibility of the Authors of the War was a biased body that excluded German testimony and ignored the evidence of Entente premeditation. This false verdict was necessary to justify the economic and territorial dismemberment of the Central Powers under a Carthaginian system.

#### **Final Strategic Takeaways**

1. **Primary Authorship:** The strategic architect of the First World War was King Edward VII; the conflict was the realization of his personal "Venetian" vision.
2. **The Entente as a Weapon:** The Triple Entente was a tool for the "encirclement" and destruction of the German Hercules, using France and Russia as expendable pawns.
3. **Enduring Instability:** Modern global instability is rooted in the "Carthaginian system" established at Versailles, a system built upon the unresolved deceptions and the homicidal legacy of the Edwardian era.

## **THE ARCHITECT OF ANNIHILATION: _A STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE REPORT ON EDWARD VII’S ENCIRCLEMENT OF GERMANY_**

### 1. The Venetian Paradigm: Edward VII as the Autocrat of Foreign Policy

Edward VII was the "Evil Demiurge" of the Triple Entente—an absolute dictator of British foreign policy who functioned as both the monarch and the supreme leader of the British oligarchy. Reviving the "Venetian tradition," Edward abandoned Britain’s "splendid isolation" to implement a ruthless strategy of shifting alliances. This Venetian paradigm dictated that Britain must always ally with the second-strongest continental power to annihilate the strongest. While the constitutional façade suggested a limited monarchy, Edward was in reality more absolute than the Kaiser or the Czar, operating a "court policy" that bypassed cabinets and parliaments to weave what the _Leipziger Neuste Nachrichten_ termed the "Nessus robe" designed to destroy the "German Hercules."

#### The Methodology of Encirclement

Edward’s geopolitical vision possessed a brutal simplicity: the total encirclement of a united Germany. By the 1870s, Edward recognized that Germany had replaced Russia as the primary threat to British maritime hegemony. His strategy sought not merely a balance of power, but a "war of annihilation" that would decimate even Britain’s supposed allies, France and Russia, leaving the continent a smoking ruin subordinate to London.

#### Foundations of the "Nessus Robe"

Edward utilized a forty-year apprenticeship as Prince of Wales to cultivate the clandestine networks necessary for this entrapment. His statecraft relied on four core pillars:

- **Personal Diplomacy:** Bypassing official channels to conduct "court policy" through direct monarchical intervention.
- **Venetian Realpolitik:** Shifting the empire’s hostility from Russia to Germany by weaponizing the "second strongest" land powers.
- **Operational Networks:** Establishing a global web of **cothinkers, agents, and dupes** in every major foreign chancery.
- **Psychological Profiling:** Exploiting the "vices and weaknesses" of foreign leaders to manipulate national policy toward British ends.

This high-level strategy was executed through a sordid network of social influence, where personal vulnerabilities were weaponized to secure strategic objectives.

### 2. The Anatomy of Influence: The Marlborough House Set and the "Homintern"

Edward’s sybaritic hedonism was the operational foundation for his recruitment of foreign assets. Through the Marlborough House Set, he utilized "Bertiemania"—orchestrated social lionization—to draw targets into his orbit. High society was not a playground; it was a recruitment ground where personal loyalty was converted into political compliance.

#### The "Homintern" and Social Blackmail

The political importance of Edward’s "Homintern" cannot be overstated. Figures like **Prince Felix Yussupov**, the Russian heir and transvestite who later assassinated Rasputin, were drawn into this web. At Cambridge, the "Apostles" secret society bound these networks together through a philosophy of "higher sodomy," creating a shared complicity and a mechanism for social blackmail that transcended borders.

#### The House of Jack the Ripper

The Edwardian court was grounded in shared secrets, none darker than the Jack the Ripper murders of 1888-89. Exhaustive evidence identifies Edward’s son, **Prince Eddy** (Duke of Clarence), as the primary suspect. The resulting cover-up was led by Gen. Sir Charles Warren, the Police Commissioner and master of the Quatuor Coronati Lodge. Critically, Edward VII personally issued the warrant for this lodge, making him the direct superior of the men who suppressed the evidence. This shared complicity in protecting the "House of Jack the Ripper" ensured absolute internal loyalty to the crown.

#### Operational Funding

Edward’s financial agency was managed by a network of private bankers who served as political operatives and were intimately linked with the leading lights of turn-of-the-century Zionism.

| Financial Operative    | Primary Strategic Utility | Intelligence Link                                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Baron von Hirsch**   | Initial Management        | Resolved Edward’s debts; entry into Viennese banking.            |
| **Sir Ernest Cassell** | Ottoman Subversion        | Headed the Ottoman National Bank; managed the Young Turk regime. |
| **The Rothschilds**    | Strategic Finance         | Provided the capital for Zionism and global geopolitical shifts. |
| **The Sassoons**       | Imperial Reach            | Facilitated British economic penetration in the Far East.        |

### 3. The Gallic Province: Clemenceau and the Subversion of France

To transform France from a rival into a "continental dagger" aimed at Germany, Edward had to dismantle French institutional resistance. He achieved this by installing **Georges "Tiger" Clemenceau** as his pro-consul.

#### The Pro-Consul Clemenceau

**Clemenceau** was a British agent and paid spy whose talent for "overthrowing governments" created the instability Edward required. Edward utilized the Panama Scandal and the Dreyfus Affair—concocted by British agents—to wreck the political machine of Leon Gambetta and break the French Army’s spirit. As Emile Flourens noted, **Clemenceau** became the administrator of the King’s "province of the Gauls."

#### The Entente Cordiale and Anti-Clericalism

The 1904 Entente Cordiale was a "very unequal barter." Britain traded a "temporary" status in Egypt (which it never left) for French preeminence in Morocco—a move guaranteed to place France on a collision course with Germany. Simultaneously, Edward orchestrated an "anti-clerical hysteria" to shut down French Catholic missions, which had previously served as barriers to British colonial expansion, replacing them with a schismatic model under his influence.

#### The Fall of Delcassé

Edward’s control was so absolute that when Foreign Minister **Théophile Delcassé** faced resignation in 1905 for refusing to seek peace with Germany, Edward docked his yacht in Algiers and sent a telegram "strongly urging" **Delcassé** to stay. The King demonstrated that **Delcassé** was acting as his personal minister, not the Republic's.

### 4. The Russian Torpedo: Izvolski and the Balkan Tinderbox

Edward’s strategy for Russia involved first crippling it as a military power via the "Asian torpedo" of Japan and the 1905 Revolution, then forcing it into a subordinate alliance.

#### Recruitment of Alexander Izvolski

In 1904, Edward recruited **Alexander Izvolski** into his personal service. When **Izvolski**’s position later weakened, Edward wrote directly to the Czar to protect his agent’s job. **Izvolski** surrendered Russian interests in Iran, Afghanistan, and Tibet to London, refocusing Russian energy on the Balkan expansionism required to trigger a general war. In Paris, **Izvolski** utilized a "Special Fund" to bribe the press to drum up war fever, later boasting of the 1914 catastrophe: "_C'est ma guerre!_"

#### The Buchlau Bargain and Balkan Friction

The 1908-1909 Balkan crisis was a manufactured humiliation. Edward’s agents blocked Russia from the Straits at the very moment Austria annexed Bosnia, then concocted a legend that Germany was responsible for the insult. This radicalized the Slavophiles and ensured the Balkan tinderbox would ignite.

#### Sazonov and the Mobilization Buttons

**Izvolski**’s successor, **Sazonov**, was another British agent who played the "key role" in the fateful mobilization of July 1914. By pushing the mobilization button first, **Sazonov** ensured the Russian "torpedo" was launched, closing the trap on the continent.

### 5. Psychological Hegemony: The Manipulation of "Willy" and "Nicky"

Edward exploited the "vices and weaknesses" of his nephews, Kaiser Wilhelm II and Czar Nicholas II, whom he viewed as pawns. The Czar recognized this too late, calling Edward the "greatest mischief-maker and the most dangerous and deceptive intriguer in the world."

#### The Enfeeblement of Kaiser Wilhelm II

Edward profiled the Kaiser’s "incurable anglophilia" and his secret, desperate desire for acceptance by the British royals. Edward modulated his behavior to provoke the Kaiser, even once punching him in a meeting to trigger a tantrum. The Kaiser’s infamous "Huns" speech and the sabotage of the Berlin-to-Baghdad railway were the direct results of Edward’s psychological dominance.

#### The Bjoerkjoe Failure

The 1905 "impotent revolt" at Bjoerkjoe, where the two cousins tried to form a "little agreement" against Edward, was doomed. Edward’s agents, including the "slippery" **von Buelow**, successfully pressured the Kaiser to abandon the treaty, ensuring no continental bloc could oppose the British "League of Cambrai."

### 6. The Final Countdown: Grey, Churchill, and the Outbreak of War

In 1914, Edward’s protégés triggered the trap.

#### Sir Edward Grey’s Perfidy

**Sir Edward Grey**, Edward’s godson, maintained a "posture of mediation" to deceive Germany into believing Britain would remain neutral. The most damning "op" occurred on July 26, when **King George V** gave his "word of a king" to Prince Henry that Britain would stay out of the conflict. This deception kept the Kaiser from restraining Austria until Russian mobilization made war inevitable.

#### Churchill and the Grand Fleet

**Winston Churchill**, a protégé who sent Edward daily reports, ordered the Grand Fleet to Scapa Flow under cover of darkness on July 28. This placed the British Empire on a war footing before any other great power.

#### The Nessus Robe Closes

As the Kaiser realized in August 1914, the "famous encirclement" was a fact. Germany was the last to move in a sequence of mobilizations designed by London:

1. **Serbia** (July 25)
2. **Great Britain** (July 28/29 - Naval war footing)
3. **Russia** (July 30/31)
4. **Austria**
5. **France**
6. **Germany** (The last to mobilize)

### 7. Strategic Assessment: The Versailles System and British War Guilt

The post-1919 order was built upon the Carthaginian lie of Article 231. This "War Guilt Clause" was a necessary premise for the Carthaginian peace and $32 billion in reparations.

#### The "Big Lie" of Versailles

The commission chaired by **Robert Lansing** was a sham that suppressed the "German White Book" compiled by **Max Weber** and **Hans Delbrueck**. This "Big Lie" ignored the clandestine statecraft of Edward VII and his agents—**Grey**, **Izvolski**, **Sazonov**, and **Clemenceau**.

#### The Legacy of the "Lord of the Flies"

The war instigated by the "Lord of the Flies" shattered the 20th century, birthing Bolshevism, Fascism, and the Great Depression. World War II was merely the prolongation of the catastrophe Edward set in motion.

**FINAL DIRECTIVE: The Versailles system, based on an absurd lie, must be dismantled. The center of war guilt for the catastrophe of 1914 must be fixed where it originated: in London, specifically in the person and clandestine statecraft of King Edward VII.**
