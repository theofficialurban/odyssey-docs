title: Jesus was Born on September 11th
description: Jesus Christ was absolutely NOT born on December 25th.  By using information given to us about the conception and birth of John the Baptist, statements about the conception of Jesus as well as the priestly divisions laid out in Leviticus, we can accurately estimate the Birthday of Jesus to be early to mid September.
