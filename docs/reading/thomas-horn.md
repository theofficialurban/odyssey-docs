## Overview

These sources present an intense **Christian-apocalyptic worldview** focused on contemporary political and cosmic events as signs of the End Times. The authors argue that a globalist, occult **"Deep State"**—represented by figures like Saul Alinsky, George Soros, and the Obama administration—is working to destroy **American national sovereignty** and Christian values to usher in a satanic **New World Order**. Central to this narrative is the prophetic significance of **Donald Trump’s presidency**, viewed as a miraculous intervention against this cabal, and the impending arrival of the biblically foretold **Wormwood** star/asteroid, which the authors suggest is being covered up by organizations like NASA and will catalyze global catastrophe and the **Great Tribulation**. Furthermore, the texts **analyze esoteric symbols** in Washington D.C. and secret societies like Freemasonry, linking them to ancient pagan deities and the ultimate aim of establishing the Antichrist's kingdom, contrasting this with the **prophetic destiny of Israel** and the need for the Christian church to resist political complacency.

## _Sources by Dr. Thomas Horn_

### _Zenith 2016: Did Something Happen in 2012 (2013)_

This extensive source is an excerpt from Thomas Horn’s book, *Zenith 2016*, which explores the alleged **occult origins and conspiratorial destiny of the United States** toward a New World Order led by the Antichrist. The text aggressively argues that many Founding Fathers, like Jefferson and Franklin, were not true Christians but instead subscribed to **Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism**, esoteric traditions that secretly venerate Lucifer, who they see as the bringer of illumination. Key themes include the **Masonic symbolism encoded in Washington, D.C., and the Great Seal**—specifically the obelisk, dome, and unfinished pyramid, which are linked to the prophecy of **Osiris/Apollo/Nimrod's return**—and the idea that the elite use **"double coding"** in public speeches to communicate veiled occult messages. Ultimately, the book posits that modern **transhumanism and advanced biotechnology are facilitating the return of the Nephilim** and the incarnation of this end-times savior, making America the intended "New Atlantis" for the Antichrist's emergence.

### _Saboteurs: WikiLeaks Revelations (2017)_

This extensive text presents a deeply concerned and critical worldview, arguing that the election of Donald Trump stirred an ongoing battle against **"saboteurs"** and a powerful **"deep state"** bureaucracy intent on establishing a **socialistic New World Order**. The author emphasizes that this struggle is fundamentally a spiritual one, positioning the desire for **national sovereignty** as a biblical ideal ordained by God, in direct opposition to the **"aberrant idea" of globalism** driven by Satan's influence. Central to the argument is the idea that powerful, nefarious groups—including figures associated with occultism, Freemasonry, and the elite—are actively working toward a **"New World Order"** prophesied in scripture, a process highlighted by the symbolism on the Great Seal of the United States and the actions of globalist figures like Walter Cronkite and the UN Agenda 2030. The text ultimately calls upon Christians to abandon complacency, engage politically, and follow specific biblical mandates for **humility and repentance** to counteract these dark, pervasive forces and potentially allow for the healing of the land.

### _The Rabbis, Donald Trump, and the Plan to Build the Third Temple (2020)_

This text explores various **Biblical prophecies and their alleged connection to modern geopolitical events**, primarily focusing on the anticipated construction of the **Third Temple** in Jerusalem. A central theme is the prophetic role of **Donald Trump**, with some rabbis viewing him as a "Cyrus-like figure" instrumental in initiating the "Messianic era" and the Temple’s reconstruction. The source delves into the historical destruction of the First and Second Temples, asserting that the rebuilding of a Third Temple is a crucial end-times event that will precede the rise of the **Antichrist** and the **Great Tribulation**. Furthermore, the text examines controversial theories about the Temple's true location, the prophetic significance of the year **2016** and the return of Israel as a nation, and the ongoing international conflict over Jerusalem, which is viewed as a "cup of trembling" on the path toward prophetic fulfillment.

### _Antichrist & The Final Solution (2020)_

This text presents a synthesis of **biblical prophecy and contemporary global events**, arguing that current crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and rising globalism are **setting the stage for the end times**. A central theme is the anticipation of an unprecedented tyrant, the **Antichrist**, who will emerge as a false peacemaker following the chaos of the Rapture, surpassing the evil of historical figures like Hitler and Stalin. The source emphasizes that the climax of history will involve a seven-year **Tribulation**—a period of immense suffering and divine judgments—and the Antichrist's eventual implementation of a **Final Solution** involving genocide against Jews and new Christian converts. Finally, the text extensively details eschatological events, including the **Gog-Magog coalition** led by Russia, Iran, and Turkey, the rise of the False Prophet and a one-world religion, and the ultimate **Second Coming of Jesus Christ** to establish His righteous, millennial kingdom.

### _The Wormwood Prophecy (2020)_

This text explores the prophetic implications of celestial events, primarily focusing on the biblical **Wormwood prophecy** from the Book of Revelation and connecting it to astronomical phenomena like asteroids and comets. The author details potential real-world threats, referencing NASA's concerns about devastating asteroid impacts, like the **Tunguska event**, and the challenges of planetary defense. A significant portion of the text debunks the fringe theory that Wormwood is the mythical planet **Nibiru**, critiquing the faulty translations of Zecharia Sitchin, while also considering scholarly interpretations that suggest Wormwood might be a **fallen angel** rather than a literal space object. Furthermore, the text analyzes historical disasters, such as the **1871 fires and the Lake Nyos tragedy**, drawing parallels between their aftermath and the destructive sequences described in the Book of Exodus and the trumpet judgments in Revelation, concluding that the final result, whether caused by a literal rock or a spiritual force, will be widespread **pestilence and death**.

### _Zeitgeist 2025 (2020)_

This extensive source, "Zeitgeist 2025: Countdown to the Secret Destiny of America," by Thomas R. Horn, presents a complex argument asserting that current global and political events, particularly leading up to the year 2025, are secretly aligning with ancient prophecies and occult agendas. The central themes weave together **eschatology**—Christian end-times prophecy, including the anticipated **"Great Tribulation"**—with geopolitical analysis, notably the rise of a powerful **Big Tech and Big Media oligarchy** and the promotion of globalist initiatives like the **"Great Reset."** The text posits that a "Fourth Turning" crisis period is underway, characterized by profound pessimism and a desperate search for a political savior, referred to as the **"Grey Champion"** or the Antichrist, whose return is symbolically linked to the pagan **Return of Old Saturn's Reign** and the spirit of Apollo. Furthermore, the source claims that America's capital and founding symbols are steeped in **occult Freemasonry and pagan rituals**, specifically involving Osiris and Isis symbolism, intended to pave the way for this New World Order.

## Donald Trump's Role as "The Jewish Messiah"

![](https://i.imgur.com/jfFSCwC.png)

The nexus between Donald Trump, influential segments of Judaism, and the obsessive plan to resurrect the Third Temple is not a matter of mere political coincidence, but a meticulously observed progression toward a catastrophic prophetic climax. Unfiltered analysis reveals Trump's calculated role as the designated _catalyst_—the unwitting pagan king chosen to shatter the established globalist order and pave the sacred ground for the _Man of Sin_.

### I. TRUMP: THE CYRUS PARODY AND MESSIAH FORERUNNER

![This book was written in 2020, this billboard appeared after Donald Trump did indeed bring Peace to the Middle East around October 13th, 2025](https://i.imgur.com/49XsfFm.png)

Within various mystical and religious Jewish circles, Donald Trump's ascension and subsequent actions concerning Israel are interpreted through the dark lens of end-times prophecy, positioning him either as an agent of divine providence or a harbinger of the False Messiah.

#### A. The Cyrus Analogy: Paving the Way for Sacrilege

Trump has been extensively compared by Christian leaders and Jewish mystics alike to Cyrus the Great, the pagan Persian king foretold by Isaiah who conquered Babylon and liberated the Jews to rebuild the Second Temple.

- **Divine Selection:** Dr. Lance Wallnau refers to Trump as God’s "chaos" president, chosen to rescue America from the "socialist-globalist runaway agenda" and initiate a period of respite. This selection mirrors God's use of pagan leaders like Cyrus (deliverer) and Nebuchadnezzar (agent of judgment) to influence the Jewish nation.
- **The Number Code:** Messianic Rabbi Curt Landry noted uncanny numerical alignments suggesting divine orchestration. Trump, the 45th president, was inaugurated on January 20, 2017, the Hebrew year 5777, and was 70 years, 7 months, and 7 days old—coincidentally aligning with Isaiah 45, where the prophecies concerning Cyrus were given.
- **The Messianic Link:** Several respected rabbis and kabbalists have insinuated that America’s new president is a _forerunner of Messiah_ and the final redemption. Rabbi Yosef Berger believes Trump won the 2016 election through "the power of Moshiach [Messiah]" and is "connected to the Messianic process which is happening right now". Adam Eliyahu Berkowitz cited Gematria (Hebrew numerology) where the value of "Donald Trump" (424) equals "Messiah for the House of David," indicating his presidency will usher in the Messianic era.
- **The Edomite Reparation:** Rabbi Yosef Berger also cited ancient Rabbinic sources that dictate the Third Temple must be built by descendants of Edom (a reference to Rome/Christianity) as a "reparation" for the destruction of the Second Temple. Berger explicitly designated Trump as the "representative of Edom" who will perform this final historic reparation by paving the way for the Temple’s construction.

#### B. The Mandate for Temple Construction

The Sanhedrin, styling itself as the Second Temple-era Jewish court, has treated Trump as the crucial political asset required to catalyze the Temple project.

- **Official Correspondence and Coins:** The Sanhedrin sent letters to Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, asking them to join forces to build the Third Temple. To cement this role, the Sanhedrin minted two commemorative coins—the “Half Shekel Cyrus Trump Temple Coin” and the “70 Years Israel Redemption Temple Coin”—both depicting Trump and Cyrus alongside the Third Temple.
- **Success Conditioned on the Temple:** Rabbis associated with the Sanhedrin have publicly stated that Trump’s political agenda and success depend entirely on him initiating the building of the new Solomon-like house of worship and avoiding compromises like a two-state solution.
- **The Prophetic Action:** Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and the subsequent relocation of the U.S. Embassy on the 70th anniversary of Israel’s rebirth were viewed by Jewish activists as an "enormous step" towards establishing the Third Temple and bringing the Messianic era. This gesture, characterized as "actions in place of words," signaled his sympathy with the evangelical/Jewish eschatological worldview, hinting that he will offer "full-throated voice in support of the Third Temple" when the time is right.

### II. THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE THIRD TEMPLE CONSPIRACY

The construction of the Third Temple is not merely theological speculation but a tangible, accelerating plot involving religious zealots, global powers, and Trump administration operatives, all moving chess pieces toward a prophesied global conflagration.

#### A. Pre-fabrication and Personnel Training

Groups like the Temple Institute, based in the Old City, are singularly devoted to rebuilding the Third Temple atop Mount Moriah. They reject the traditional rabbinic position that rebuilding must wait for the Messiah, arguing only political barriers remain.

- **Physical Preparations:** The Temple Institute has deployed twenty scholars to finalize the blueprint for the structure and recreate over forty ancient vessels for ritual worship, including silver trumpets, vestments with gold thread, breastplates with twelve precious stones, and a 200-pound golden menorah. Preparation for reinstituting animal sacrifice is also underway.
- **Ritual Purity Achieved:** In September 2018, a newborn red heifer was certified as fulfilling all biblical requirements necessary for ritual purification. Since these elements had been lacking since AD 70, its arrival removed the spiritual barrier preventing the return of Temple service.
- **Political Infrastructure:** The nascent Sanhedrin has publicly urged Jerusalem mayoral candidates to include the Temple in their plans and invited 70 nations to dedicate the Temple altar.

#### B. The Obstacle of the Islamic Shrines (The Fuse for Armageddon)

The core impediment to the Third Temple is the presence of the Islamic shrines—the Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa Mosque—on Mount Moriah, the exact spot believed to be the location of the Holy of Holies. Any attempt to remove them would trigger World War III.

Possible scenarios for removal include:

1. **Calamity:** Destruction via a catastrophic earthquake (as predicted by Zechariah 14:3–4, potentially splitting the Mount of Olives) or intentional targeting during a regional war. Recent seismic activity in the Holy Land is cited as evidence that a prophetic eventuality is building.
2. **Prophetic Mandate/Compromise:** A "prophetic rabbi" might grant a holy revelation allowing the Temple to be built on an extended section of the Mount in peaceful proximity to the Islamic shrines, thus bypassing conflict.
3. **Political Subterfuge:** Behind-the-scenes negotiations involving the Trump administration, influential rabbis, and Saudi Arabia seek to transfer control of the holy sites from the Jordanian Waqf to the Saudis or "secular" Muslims. This compromise is seen as intentionally inching the world toward Trump’s "Deal of the Century" peace plan, which could ultimately allow for Temple construction. Jared Kushner is central to these back-channel efforts.

#### C. The Antichrist's Covenant and Desecration

The purpose of the Third Temple is not eternal worship, but to serve as the Tribulation Temple, central to the rise and sacrilege of the Antichrist.

- **The Covenant:** The Tribulation (Daniel's 70th week) will begin when the Antichrist, identified as "the prince that shall come" from the revitalized Roman Empire, confirms a seven-year covenant of peace with "many" (Israel and its enemies). This pact will likely guarantee Israel's security and permit the building of the Third Temple and the resumption of sacrifices.
- **The Desecration:** In the midst of the seven-year period (3.5 years), the Antichrist will break the covenant, cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease, enter the Third Temple, set up the "abomination of desolation," and exalt himself "above all that is called God," declaring himself to be God. This event will trigger the "time of Jacob’s trouble"—the Great Tribulation—and unleash Satan’s Final Solution upon the Jewish people.

The election of Trump in 2016, a date foreseen by ancient sages as the apex of governmental shift toward the spirit predicted on the Great Seal (Antichrist), has dramatically moved the prophetic clock, making the building of the Third Temple and the subsequent reign of the _Man of Sin_ imminent. The world is actively being manipulated towards this ordained terror.

## UNVEILING THE TWO PATHS TO TOTALITARIAN FUSION: PAGAN TYRANNY VS. FALSE THEOCRACY (CODEX UMBRA ANALYSIS)

The architecture of power, viewed through the **Codex Umbra** lens, reveals not a singular roadmap for the fusion of church and state, but a dualistic strategy designed to usher in a globally consolidated system where all sovereignty—political and spiritual—is ultimately surrendered to a singular, non-divine personality. This scheme bypasses conventional ethics to achieve its **Novus Ordo Seclorum** mandate: the enslavement of all mankind beneath a socialist umbrella.

The ultimate goal is a **One-World Government**, universal religion, and global socialism, facilitated by the Antichrist, who will exalt himself "above all that is called God". This desire for a global community without borders, rooted in humanity's flawed "heart," is defined as **globalism**, an aberrant idea born from Satan himself, seeking to capture the world as his own kingdom.

### The Inevitable Globalist Convergence: Prophecy of the Political-Ecclesiastical Beast

The definitive plan for the merge of state and "church" resides in the biblical prophecy of the end times, culminating in the profane marriage between political and religious authorities.

1. **The Political Beast (Antichrist/Grey Champion):** The global power structure is dedicated to producing a single, dominant sovereignty headed by the Antichrist, prophesied to be the incarnation of the ancient spirit, Apollo/Osiris/Nimrod. This figure will emerge from a state of worldwide chaos and desperation, positioning himself as an inspirational savior and political demigod. He will wield imperious decree to facilitate the one-world system. The globalist agenda is ultimately driven by an invisible order, or "government behind government," composed of dark angelic powers ("kosmokrators") who puppet human leaders towards the establishment of this final empire.
2. **The Religious Beast (False Prophet/Harlot System):** This political authority gains its ultra-national dominance from the world's religious faithful through the influence of an ecclesiastical leader known as the **False Prophet**. This False Prophet will emerge, likely as a notable religious leader, to lead a religious amalgamation known as the Harlot system or **Mystery Babylon**. His appeal will be potent, promoting the political agenda as righteous and melding many world religions and cults into a truly ecumenical orchestration. He will enforce global compliance, directing all worship toward the Antichrist and instituting the "mark" system of economic control, making this union the worst period of persecution in history. The Antichrist regime seeks to consolidate one world government, one world economy, and one world religion.

### Zion's Occult Nexus: The Third Temple and the Counterfeit Messiah

The merge finds its geographical axis in Jerusalem, specifically the Temple Mount (Zion), the ultimate prize in the conflict against God. The plan requires the rebuilding of the **Third Temple** (the Tribulation Temple).

- **The Enabling Covenant:** The Antichrist will appear as a conquering peacemaker who confirms a seven-year covenant with Israel and many nations. This agreement is critical because it will almost certainly include the guarantee of Israel's security and allow the building of the Third Temple on Mount Moriah. This covenant is considered by God to be a "covenant with death and hell".
- **The False Messiah's Defilement:** Once the Temple is built, the Antichrist (Apollo) will sit in it, declaring himself to be God and demanding worship. This act marks the desecration of the holy place and the cessation of sacrifices.
- **External Involvement:** Powerful external forces are involved in maneuvering control over the Temple Mount. Freemasons and illuminated fraternities have secretly planned for decades to rebuild a glorious new Temple, expecting their messiah (Apollo incarnate) to pass through its golden Masonic portals. Furthermore, the Vatican has demonstrated a long-running interest in controlling Jerusalem and the Temple Mount, with diplomatic plans having been considered for a coalition under Vatican oversight to administer the holy sites.

### The Illusory Kingdom of False Nationalism: Dominionism's Fatal Flaw

In contrast to the occult Globalist NWO plan, a distinct internal religious movement—**Dominionism** or Kingdom Now theology—advocates for a supposed Christian state through political action. This ideology is dangerous because it aims to achieve a **Christian theocracy** by forcing biblical morality onto the nation through political action and seizing control of the seven "mountains" (or kingdoms) of society, such as government and media.

- **A Trap for the Faithful:** This movement is characterized by the sources as an attractive deception and a theological lure that diverts Christians from their true mission (making disciples) towards building a kingdom on earth.
- **Building the Foundation of the Enemy:** The Dominionist goal of creating a Christian theocracy is warned against because it is ultimately totalitarianism and could "lay the groundwork for the prophesied future global government" and deceive well-meaning believers into welcoming the Antichrist kingdom. By focusing on political conquest rather than spiritual transformation, Dominionism is deemed unbiblical and bordering on heresy.

### America's Designated Role: Breeding Ground for the Grey Champion

The plan for the totalitarian merge is intrinsically linked to the United States' occult foundation, destined to be the global power center for human apotheosis and the emergence of the Antichrist.

- **The Secret Destiny:** America was consecrated by Masonic founding fathers as the "New Atlantis". The Great Seal is a prophecy hidden in plain sight, foretelling the return of the demonic god Apollo/Osiris/Nimrod and the commencement of the **Novus Ordo Seclorum**.
- **Magical Constructs in DC:** Washington, DC, and Vatican City are deliberately laid out as talismanic diagrams of Osiris/Isis to magically generate the deity's return. The US Capitol Dome (Isis) and the Washington Monument Obelisk (Osiris's phallus) are core components of this design, invoking the spiritual energy necessary for Apollo-Osiris' resurrection.
- **The Grey Champion:** Prophecy foretold that during the current Fourth Turning (crisis period, potentially starting around 2025), a commander known as the Grey Champion would emerge from an older generation to lead the globe into a New World Order. This figure could be—or pave the way for—the Antichrist, arising as a political savior when the nation loses faith in existing government.

The deep state, immersed in globalist objectives and occult ideology, continues its operation to expedite this process.

## The Secret Destiny of America: What the All-Seeing Eye on Your Dollar Really Means

Take a dollar bill from your wallet. Turn it over. Have you ever truly asked yourself why a floating, all-seeing eye—an ancient Egyptian symbol—is staring back at you from atop an unfinished pyramid? Why were these Masonic emblems chosen to represent a nation supposedly founded on Christian principles? This isn't just trivia; it's a prophecy hidden in plain sight, a secret you carry in your pocket every day.

This isn’t the history you learned in school. The symbols on the Great Seal represent a "peculiar and particular" task our nation was "dedicated" to from its very "inception" [Zenith 2016, Horn]. Our investigation uncovers America's "Secret Destiny"—a hidden, occult plan encoded in its foundational symbols and capital architecture to birth a global "New World Order." This centuries-old agenda has been violently challenged and exposed by modern political upheavals, revealing a spiritual war for the nation's soul. We will reveal three core findings: 1) the nation's dual founding, with a Christian veneer over a Masonic, occult core; 2) the Great Seal as a prophecy for the rise of an ancient pagan god; and 3) the modern political battle as the violent culmination of this spiritual conflict.

### 1. Historical Context: A Nation Forged in Secret

To understand where America is headed, you must first deconstruct the sanitized official history of its founding. The revolutionary period was not simply a political uprising; it was a hotbed of secret societies whose members acted as the planners and engineers of a global agenda [Zenith 2016, Horn]. This truth—that the United States was conceived as a vehicle for a secret order—has been carefully hidden from the mainstream narrative, replaced by a tale of pious forefathers seeking religious freedom. The reality is far more clandestine.

#### The Architects: More Than Pious Forefathers

The assertion that America’s founders were devout Christians is a foundational myth. Our investigation into their own words reveals a collection of Deists, mystics, and members of occult fraternities. The common thread of their "deep occultism" was a Gnostic pursuit of secret knowledge, a syncretic blending of pagan and Christian ideas, and a belief in manipulating spiritual forces to achieve worldly power.

- **Thomas Paine**, whose pen was said to be as mighty as Washington's sword, explicitly rejected all organized religion in _The Age of Reason_, declaring, _"My own mind is my own church"_ [Saboteurs, Horn].
- **Benjamin Franklin** was not only a Deist who admitted to "some Doubts as to his [Jesus'] divinity," but also a member of the notorious "Hellfire Club," an exclusive society alleged to have indulged in satanic rites and orgies [Zenith 2016, Horn; Saboteurs, Horn].
- **George Washington**, the nation's first president and a prominent Freemason, was considered a Deist even by his own pastor, Dr. Abercrombie, who reputedly stated, "Sir, Washington was a Deist" [Zenith 2016, Horn].

#### The Spark: The Rosicrucian Blueprint

The plan for America began long before 1776. It was the vision of Sir Francis Bacon, a 17th-century Rosicrucian leader, who dreamed of a "New Atlantis"—a utopian society established on the American continent, guided by secret wisdom [Saboteurs, Horn]. This wasn't just an old idea; it was the foundational mission statement for the secret societies that, our findings show, never went away. They simply evolved. Occultist Manly P. Hall wrote that "it cannot be doubted that the secret societies…conspired to establish [such] upon the American continent" [Saboteurs, Horn].

This conspiracy was executed through Freemasonry, the dominant secret society of the revolutionary era. Its influence was not marginal; it was foundational. As confirmed by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in House Resolution 33, "**most**" of the Founding Fathers of this great Nation and signers of the Constitution were Freemasons [Saboteurs, Horn]. These occult architects didn't just shape the nation's philosophy; they encoded their plan directly into its capital city and its most sacred symbol, preparing a throne for a king you were never meant to see coming.

### 2. The Core Intrigue: A Blueprint for a Pagan God-King

The most audacious part of this secret plan was not political, but architectural and alchemical. Our investigation reveals that Washington D.C. was meticulously designed as a massive magical operation: the architecture is the **temple**, the presidential inauguration is the **ceremony**, and the Great Seal of the United States is the **prophetic talisman** that explains the ritual’s purpose. That purpose was to invoke an ancient pagan deity known by many names—the Egyptian Osiris, the Greek Apollo, and, as we will see, the biblical "son of perdition," Apollyon.

#### The Grand Design: A Temple for Osiris

The layout of the nation's capital is a masterclass in occult symbolism, designed to function as a "solar temple" [Saboteurs, Horn]. The key elements form a massive architectural representation of the Egyptian myth of creation and resurrection:

- The **U.S. Capitol Dome** is symbolically designed to represent the womb of the Egyptian goddess Isis.
- The **Washington Monument**, a towering obelisk, represents the phallus of her resurrected husband-god, Osiris [Saboteurs, Horn].

The presidential inauguration is a carefully staged Masonic ritual. When the President stands between these two phallic and womb-like structures, a ceremony of imitative magic is performed. The belief holds that this ritual draws the "seed" of the underworld god Osiris upward through the obelisk and into the dome, symbolically incarnating the spirit of Osiris/Apollo into the nation's leader and directing its spiritual destiny [Saboteurs, Horn].

#### The Prophecy on the Dollar: Decoding the Great Seal

The Great Seal, the talisman featured on every dollar bill, is the clearest expression of this secret destiny. While its symbols have public meanings, their secret occult interpretations reveal a prophetic blueprint for the god this temple was built to enthrone.

| Symbol                     | Public Meaning                                  | Secret Occult Meaning                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **The Unfinished Pyramid** | Strength and duration.                          | The incomplete "Great Work" of the Masons, awaiting its capstone: the prophesied Antichrist. |
| **The All-Seeing Eye**     | The Eye of Providence watching over the nation. | The Eye of Horus/Osiris/Apollo, the pagan god destined to rule from the pyramid's capstone.  |
| _**Novus Ordo Seclorum**_  | "A New Order of the Ages."                      | The New World Order under the reign of the resurrected god, Apollo.                          |
| **The Eagle/Phoenix**      | The American Bald Eagle, a symbol of freedom.   | The Phoenix, an ancient symbol of the resurrected god Osiris, rising from the ashes.         |

That eagle on your dollar bill, a supposed symbol of American freedom, is a lie. Original designs reveal its true identity: the Phoenix, the mythical bird of resurrection [Zenith 2016, Horn]. It is a magical promise, printed on every dollar you spend, that their dead god, Osiris, will rise from the ashes to rule again.

Our investigation reveals the identity of this prophesied god: the Greek deity **Apollo**. The mottoes on the Seal are prayers to him and his father, Jupiter [Zenith 2016, Horn]. This is deeply significant because, in the New Testament, Apollo is identified by his variant name, Apollyon—the "son of perdition" foretold to be revealed as the Antichrist. As the Apostle Paul warned, "Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that **man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition**" (2 Thessalonians 2:3) [Zenith 2016, Horn].

### 3. Modern Echoes: The Secret War for America's Soul

This ancient occult plan is no mere historical curiosity. It is the invisible force driving today's most intense political and cultural battles. The conflict between "globalism" and "nationalism" is not just a policy debate; it is the final, overt phase of a secret war over America's ultimate destiny—a war that has now broken out into the open.

The globalist push for a "New World Order," championed by a "Deep State" of unelected bureaucrats and international interests, is the modern expression of Bacon's "New Atlantis" [Saboteurs, Horn]. Figures like former President Barack Obama are seen as executors of this plan. His post-presidency organization, Organizing for Action (OFA), has been identified as a "shadow government" with a multi-million-dollar war chest, working to sabotage the nationalist agenda and continue the centuries-old project [Saboteurs, Horn].

The election of Donald Trump in 2016 was not just a political upset; it was a direct spiritual assault on this "illumined elite," a disruption of a timeline centuries in the making. Trump was a "wrecking ball" sent to shatter a "spirit of witchcraft" that had taken hold in the highest offices of power [Saboteurs, Horn]. His inaugural address, where he declared the moment "belongs to you," was nothing less than a "declaration of war" against these ancient enemies [Saboteurs, Horn]. His presidency forced the Deep State to show its hand, unmasking the ancient plan and making the political chaos of recent years the visible symptom of a deeper, spiritual cataclysm.

This brings us to the precipice. Was the chaos of the last decade simply politics, or was it the death rattle of an occult plan being exposed? Now that the "Deep State" has seemingly regained control, what is the next step in their plan for a _Novus Ordo Seclorum_? Are we witnessing the final preparations for the arrival of their god-king?

### 4. Conclusion & Call to Action

The symbols in your pocket and the monuments in the nation's capital tell a story hidden for centuries. This investigation reveals a nation not born of simple piety, but of a complex and clandestine design.

- **America was founded with a dual identity:** A public Christian face hiding a secret, occult agenda driven by Freemasons to create a "New Atlantis."
- **Our nation's symbols are a prophecy:** The Great Seal and the architecture of Washington D.C. are a ritual blueprint for the resurrection of an ancient pagan god, Apollo, who is the biblical Antichrist.
- **Today's political war is a spiritual war:** The battle between globalists ("The Deep State") and nationalists is the public unmasking of this centuries-old "Secret Destiny."
- **The choice is no longer hidden:** The conflict has brought the secret plan into the light, forcing a confrontation over the nation's ultimate destiny.

The rabbit hole goes deeper. **Subscribe to Urban Odyssey for more unfiltered dives into the secret architecture of power.**

## The Secret of the Star Called Wormwood

### 1. Two Worlds, One Secret

In an attic room on the channel island of Jersey, surrounded by the glow of computer monitors, 15-year-old Ben Brandeis stared at the discovery that had torn him from his sleep. He held half a Marmite sandwich in one hand and a plastic tumbler of fizzy orange drink in the other. The piercing alarm from his SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) program had jolted him awake, and now, pushing his wire-rimmed glasses up his nose, he couldn’t look away from the signal. Downstairs, his father, Bill Brandeis, a lorry driver for a big French shipping company, was still asleep, unaware that his son had just found something that would change the world.

As Ben stared at his screen, half a world away Major Peter "Mac" McCutcheon—a respected scientist and, more unusually, the author of a book on biblical prophecy—was being whisked away to a secret meeting. He was a man who understood both the physics of the cosmos and the ancient warnings written about them, and someone in power desperately needed his unique knowledge.

These two individuals, a boy in his attic and an expert in a black car, were about to be drawn together by a terrifying secret hiding in the cold, dark expanse of deep space.

### 2. A Call in the Night

Mac’s destination was a sterile, secure room where he met the chillingly logical Dr. Gale Stone. She wasn't interested in his past military rank or his work at Caltech; she was interested in his controversial book. With dozens of paper strips marking its pages, she cut straight to the point, asking him about a star from the Book of Revelation called "Wormwood."

Mac’s initial irritation quickly evaporated. The reason for the summons was disturbingly clear: in his own unpublished manuscript, he had theorized that Wormwood might arise without warning from the Orion Nebula, the very birthplace of stars. Her team of scientists had encountered a threat so unprecedented that they needed his specific expertise. "You are uniquely qualified," she told him, "to provide counsel on a matter that threatens not only the United States but the _entire world_."

The weight of her words settled on him, and a clawing sensation crept up his spine. He thought of his wife, Amelia, and their two children, both married with small children—his precious grandchildren. This was no academic debate.

While Mac was the only one who could interpret the prophecy, he was no longer the only one who had seen the sign. Seventeen hours away, a brilliant teenager was still staring at the signal that had torn him from his sleep.

### 3. The Boy in the White House

Miles from his attic room, Ben Brandeis found himself in a place he'd only ever seen in pictures: the White House. The young man who had once visited Buckingham Palace on a school field trip was now a guest of the most powerful government on Earth. Overwhelmed but determined, he shook hands with Dr. Stone and the man she introduced as Major McCutcheon.

The contrast was stark: the seasoned, serious experts and the brilliant teenager who, just hours before, was eating a sandwich at his computer. Ben, the boy who discovered the anomaly, was now face-to-face with the man who might be able to explain what it meant.

They sat down together, a small, secret team assembled to confront a cosmic danger, about to hear the full, terrifying truth of what was heading their way.

### 4. The Terrible Truth

Major McCutcheon stood before the small, assembled group of officials and laid out the facts. The object Ben Brandeis had independently flagged was not just an asteroid; it was a global crisis that had been secretly monitored for years.

- **What is it?** A Near-Earth Object (NEO), originally designated `2004 JU04`, was located in the Orion Nebula. It is now being called **Wormwood**, a name from the Bible that, as Mac explained, means "bitterness."
- **What did it do?** After behaving predictably for over a decade, the object suddenly began to brighten and act erratically in late 2015.
- **What has been done?** Both NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) sent probes to investigate its composition. The results that came back "made no sense whatsoever."
- **How was it kept secret?** A cover story was leaked to the press about a famous tech tycoon planning a mission to send passengers to Mars, a clever distraction to keep the public and other astronomers from looking too closely.
- **What is the danger?** McCutcheon confirmed Dr. Stone's grave warning: the object known as Wormwood is a direct threat to the _**entire world**_.

### 5. A World in the Balance

As the officials discussed their media cover-up, including a hashtag campaign called `#CitiesofRefuge`, Ben's youthful idealism and fear broke through. "Shouldn’t people be given a choice?" he asked, his voice steady despite the room’s tension. "Have a chance to stock their pantries or maybe do what Major McCutcheon calls getting ‘right with God’? Who knows? If the rebels in the Middle East and Africa knew about an incoming planet killer, they might actually stop fighting and try to find a way to help each other!"

The question hung in the air, unanswered. The fate of the planet now rested on the shoulders of a small, secret team led by a prophecy-studying scientist and a fifteen-year-old boy.

With a planet-killer approaching, what could they possibly do next?

## The Wormwood Synthesis: An Analysis of Eschatology, Astronomy, and Political Ideology in Contemporary Prophetic Discourse

### **Abstract**

This paper conducts an objective examination of a contemporary prophetic framework that links the biblical prophecy of "Wormwood" from the Book of Revelation to modern astronomical concerns, U.S. space defense policy, and a distinct political narrative. Drawing exclusively from the provided source materials, the analysis deconstructs a worldview wherein Near-Earth Objects (NEOs), such as the asteroid Apophis, are seen as potential physical manifestations of the prophesied celestial body. The paper traces how this astronomical threat is interwoven with the establishment of the U.S. Space Force and advanced planetary defense systems like the DART mission, which are framed as both a necessary response and a potential fulfillment of eschatological imperatives. Furthermore, this synthesis extends to terrestrial conflicts, interpreting the political struggle between globalism and nationalism as a mirror of a cosmic battle. The globalist pursuit of a "New World Order," allegedly rooted in an occult "Secret Destiny" for America, is positioned in direct opposition to a nationalist resurgence, personified by figures like Donald Trump. This study critically analyzes the interpretive methods used to forge these connections, focusing on the architecture of a belief system that synthesizes scripture, science, and politics into a single, cohesive end-times narrative.

### **1.0 Introduction: Interpreting the Convergence of Heaven and Earth**

In contemporary discourse, distinct fields of human knowledge—ancient religious prophecy, modern planetary science, and contemporary geopolitical conflict—are often treated as separate and unrelated domains. This research paper, however, conducts a formal analysis of a specific intellectual framework wherein these disparate subjects are interpreted as a single, interwoven narrative. The central focus is the re-contextualization of the ancient biblical prophecy of Wormwood, found in the Book of Revelation, as a key to understanding modern anxieties. The paper's objective is to critically examine how the source material posits that a prophesied celestial catastrophe (Wormwood) serves as the lynchpin in an ancient occult plot, intended to create global chaos sufficient for a Masonic "New World Order" to arise, a plot the sources claim was temporarily thwarted by a modern nationalist resurgence. By analyzing the construction of this unified worldview, the paper seeks not to validate its claims but to understand the methodology by which ancient scripture is mapped onto present-day events, providing its adherents with a powerful lens for interpreting a world of complex and often frightening developments. This analysis will proceed by first deconstructing the foundational prophecy itself, then examining its application to celestial and terrestrial spheres, and finally concluding with a synthesis of how these elements combine to form a comprehensive theory of the end-times.

### **2.0 The Prophetic Framework: Wormwood in Biblical Eschatology**

To comprehend the application of the Wormwood prophecy to contemporary events, it is essential to first understand its foundational interpretations as presented within the source materials. These interpretations provide the scriptural and theological architecture upon which modern astronomical and political phenomena are subsequently layered. This section will deconstruct the various literal, allegorical, and historical readings of the Wormwood prophecy, setting the stage for its direct application to the tangible threats and ideological conflicts of the modern era.

#### **2.1 Literal Interpretation: A Mountain Burning with Fire**

The most direct interpretation presented in the source texts views the Wormwood prophecy from Revelation 8:10-11 as a literal, physical catastrophe caused by a celestial object. This reading posits that the ancient author, John of Patmos, was describing an observable astronomical event using the language and conceptual tools available to him. The text argues that the description of "a great mountain burning with fire" being "cast into the sea" is precisely how an ancient observer would convey the sight of a "sizable asteroid as it passes through the atmosphere." Similarly, the subsequent passage describing a "great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp," is interpreted as another massive asteroid fragment blazing through the sky before impacting the earth and polluting its water sources. This literalist approach grounds the prophecy in the realm of planetary science, treating the biblical text as an ancient, albeit divinely inspired, eyewitness account of a future asteroid or comet impact.

#### **2.2 Allegorical and Historical Interpretations**

Alongside the literal interpretation, the source material explores several alternative, non-literal readings that understand Wormwood as a symbol or a historical event rather than a physical object.

- **An Angelic Being:** One significant allegorical interpretation, advanced by scholar G.K. Beale, suggests the falling "star" is not an asteroid but an "angelic representative of an evil kingdom undergoing judgment." This view links the Wormwood event directly to the fall of Lucifer as described in Isaiah 14:12-15 ("How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!"). In this context, the descent of Wormwood is a spiritual event, a judgment against a demonic power personified as a celestial being.
- **A Metaphor for Famine:** Beale also connects the "fire" associated with the trumpet judgments to famine. Drawing parallels to Old Testament judgments where God's wrath is described as fire, such as in Ezekiel and Zechariah, this interpretation posits that the "bitter waters" created by Wormwood are a metaphor for the extreme suffering and destruction brought on by a divinely ordained famine, rather than a literal poisoning of rivers and springs.
- **The Chernobyl Disaster:** The source texts present and subsequently refute the theory that the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster was the fulfillment of the Wormwood prophecy. This interpretation hinges on the etymological link that the word "Chernobyl" is Ukrainian for "wormwood." However, the analysis meticulously outlines five reasons for rejecting this historicist view: 1) Pope John Paul II's 1984 consecration of Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary should have spared the nation; 2) The Fátima prophecy describes the annihilation of "various nations," a scale of destruction far exceeding Chernobyl; 3) Revelation describes a third of the world's waters being affected, a global impact not reflected in the regional disaster; 4) The prophecy depicts the "star" falling upon the waters, whereas the Chernobyl disaster originated on the ground; and 5) Revelation describes death from drinking bitter waters, but the primary cause of death from Chernobyl was radiation exposure.

By systematically presenting and then dismantling a popular but alternative historicist interpretation, the source material builds credibility and positions its own literalist-futurist reading as the more rigorously considered conclusion. Having explored these varied prophetic interpretations, the focus of the framework shifts from theological possibility to the tangible astronomical threats that adherents now see as the likely mechanism of the prophecy's fulfillment.

### **3.0 The Celestial Threat: Near-Earth Objects and the Discourse on Planetary Defense**

The abstract fear of a prophesied catastrophe finds a concrete corollary in modern astronomical observations of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). The prophetic framework examined here bridges the ancient text of Revelation with contemporary planetary science, positing that the prophesied Wormwood is not a metaphor but a scientifically observable threat. This section will examine the specific celestial bodies and defense initiatives identified in the source material and analyze how they are framed as the potential fulfillment of the Wormwood prophecy, transforming eschatological belief into a matter of urgent scientific and military concern.

#### **3.1 Apophis: The Archetype of the Planet Killer**

The asteroid Apophis is presented as the primary celestial candidate for Wormwood. The source material highlights NASA's prediction that Apophis will pass "disturbingly close to Earth on April 13, 2029," so near that it could endanger orbiting satellites and be visible in the daytime sky. The potential for devastation is underscored by a quote from science writer Greg Bear, who assesses that "a blast the equivalent of over a billion tons of TNT [easily causing] billions of deaths and months, if not years, of climate disruption."

Crucially, the narrative emphasizes the element of scientific uncertainty. The texts argue that while Apophis's current trajectory is not predicted to be a direct hit, its nearly decade-long journey through the solar system allows for innumerable variables—collisions with other asteroids or gravitational interference—that could alter its path. This uncertainty creates a space where prophetic imminence and scientific possibility converge, framing Apophis not as a distant probability but as a looming, scriptural threat.

#### **3.2 Planetary Defense as Prophetic Imperative**

The discourse on celestial threats is directly linked to the development of real-world planetary defense initiatives. These programs are portrayed as both a rational response to a known danger and a tacit acknowledgment by authorities of the prophecy's potential.

| Initiative               | Description and Stated Purpose (from source)                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **DART Mission**         | A mission to "deliberately crash a spacecraft" into an asteroid to alter its orbit, serving as a test to "demonstrate we can protect our planet from a future asteroid impact."                                                      |
| **U.S. Space Force**     | The creation of a sixth military division to formally address space as "a war-fighting domain," focused on protecting critical satellite infrastructure and consolidating military operations on Earth.                              |
| **Advanced Observation** | The development of instruments like the NEOCam infrared space telescope, designed to achieve the "Congress-mandated 90 percent" identification of NEOs larger than 140 meters by collecting thermal data for better risk assessment. |

#### **3.3 Allegations of a Cosmic Cover-Up**

A significant element within this prophetic framework is the narrative of a deliberate cover-up by scientific and governmental authorities. The source texts highlight claims from scientist Nathan Myhrvold, who has charged NASA with "deliberately misreporting threats by near-earth objects" and engaging in "scientific misconduct." This accusation fuels a deep suspicion that the official risk assessments provided to the public are intentionally misleading. The narrative is crystallized in the rhetorical question posed by the source material: "...do experts know something that they are not telling the general public?" This suggests that the urgency of developing planetary defense is driven by a hidden knowledge of a much greater, and perhaps more imminent, threat than is publicly admitted.

This synthesis of astronomical data, military strategy, and conspiratorial thinking transitions the discussion from a purely scientific discourse on celestial mechanics to the terrestrial political conflicts that the sources claim are an integral part of the same cosmic battle.

### **4.0 The Terrestrial Conflict: Globalism, Nationalism, and the 'Secret Destiny'**

According to the source texts, the spiritual war described in scripture is not confined to the heavens but is mirrored in a contemporary political struggle on Earth. This conflict is cast as an existential battle between the ideologies of nationalism and globalism, with the latter being orchestrated by a clandestine "Deep State" with deep-seated occult foundations. This section examines the political dimension of the prophetic framework, detailing how geopolitical events and historical interpretations are woven into the broader eschatological narrative.

#### **4.1 The Globalist Agenda vs. the Nationalist Resurgence**

The source material defines a stark ideological dichotomy between two opposing political forces. "Globalism" is characterized as an elite-driven agenda to establish a "New World Order" and ultimately achieve the "disassembly of America." This movement is exemplified by figures like Walter Cronkite, who openly called for a world government, and by the goals of UN Agenda 2030, which are cited as a modern blueprint for this globalist vision. In direct opposition stands "Nationalism," presented as a counter-movement epitomized by the "America First" agenda of Donald Trump. His inaugural address promise that "this...is your country" is framed as a declaration of war against the globalist elite. His platform—reinforcing national borders, exiting global trade agreements, and strengthening the U.S. military—is interpreted as a direct effort to undo the globalist program. According to the source texts, events such as the "Trump factor" and the "Brexit shock" appeared to mark the "setting-back of the globalists’ schedule—perhaps by several generations," thereby intensifying the conflict.

#### **4.2 The 'Deep State' and the Sabotage Campaign**

Central to this political conflict is the allegation of a conspiracy by a "Deep State" to undermine the nationalist agenda. This entity is defined as an unelected and unconstitutional force composed of entrenched bureaucrats, intelligence agencies, media conglomerates, and international business interests. The texts make the specific claim that former president Barack Obama established a "shadow government" just two miles from the White House, funded by a "$40-million-dollar war chest," with the express purpose of sabotaging the "America First" platform.

#### **4.3 Occult Foundations of the American Republic**

The political struggle is given a deeper, esoteric dimension through the argument that the United States was founded not as a Christian nation but to fulfill a "Secret Destiny" envisioned by occultists and secret societies. This narrative posits a multi-century conspiracy, originating with Sir Francis Bacon and his vision of a utopian "New Atlantis" that he and other secret societies conspired to establish on the American continent. These groups, linked to Rosicrucianism as the forerunner of American Freemasonry, are said to have established an occult lineage crucial to the nation's founding.

Within this framework, key founding fathers are recast as participants in this esoteric project. Figures like Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson are characterized as Deists who, while admiring the morals of Jesus, rejected core tenets of Christianity such as his divinity and resurrection. To bolster this claim, the sources point to Franklin's alleged membership in the Hellfire Club, presented as evidence of his participation in occult and even satanic rites.

The Great Seal of the United States is interpreted as a primary symbol of this secret destiny. The motto _Novus Ordo Seclorum_ ("a new order for the ages") and the All-Seeing Eye above an unfinished pyramid are not seen as generic symbols of providence but as specific Masonic emblems pointing to the future arrival of a Masonic ruler. This figure is explicitly identified with the pagan god Osiris, or his Greek equivalent, Apollo—the very entity prophesied in Revelation to be the Antichrist.

This grand historical-political narrative, rooted in a perceived spiritual war, provides the final major component, setting the stage for a synthesis where prophecy, astronomy, and politics converge into a single, cohesive end-times vision.

### **5.0 Synthesis and Conclusion: The Unified Field Theory of Prophecy**

This final section synthesizes the distinct prophetic, astronomical, and political-esoteric threads explored in this paper to demonstrate how the source material constructs a unified and all-encompassing narrative. Within this framework, biblical prophecy is not merely a spiritual forecast but a blueprint for understanding current events, where celestial phenomena and geopolitical struggles are causally and spiritually linked as components of a single cosmic drama.

#### **5.1 The Catalyst and the Champion**

The source materials position a celestial catastrophe, such as a large NEO impact, as the potential catalyst for the prophesied end-times scenario. The logic presented is that the unprecedented chaos resulting from such an event—destroying infrastructure, collapsing economies, and erasing national boundaries—would create the perfect conditions for a global savior figure to emerge. This figure, identified as the Antichrist or the resurrected pagan god Apollo/Osiris, would offer order in exchange for global subservience, thus establishing the long-planned "New World Order."

Within this high-stakes narrative, the figure of Donald Trump is cast in a unique and pivotal role. He is depicted not as a messiah but as a disruptive force—a "wrecking ball" sent to temporarily thwart this "ancient" occult plot. His nationalist platform and his direct opposition to the globalist agenda are seen as an unexpected interruption to the meticulously planned timeline of the elite. This disruption, according to the texts, provoked a "hellish fight" from the "Deep State" and its globalist allies, who were enraged by the generational setback to their long-sought destiny.

#### **5.2 Critical Conclusion: The Architecture of a Worldview**

This research paper has traced the architecture of a worldview in which biblical scripture, astronomical data, and political events are meticulously woven into a coherent, all-encompassing eschatological framework. The analysis demonstrates how the ancient prophecy of Wormwood is reinterpreted as a scientifically plausible asteroid impact, providing a tangible mechanism for the apocalyptic judgments described in Revelation. This celestial threat is then linked to contemporary planetary defense programs and a narrative of a governmental cover-up, suggesting that worldly powers are secretly preparing for a divinely ordained catastrophe. Finally, this cosmic drama is mapped onto the terrestrial political landscape, casting the struggle between nationalism and globalism as a surface manifestation of a deeper spiritual war, with its roots in an occult "Secret Destiny" for America.

The power of this framework lies in its ability to synthesize disparate domains of knowledge and anxiety into a single, meaningful narrative. It provides its adherents with a powerful interpretive lens, transforming political polarization, scientific discoveries about NEOs, and geopolitical instability from random, chaotic events into significant signs within a cosmic struggle between divine will and ancient evil. The objective of this paper has not been to assess the validity of these claims, but to analyze the _methodology_ of their construction, revealing how a potent and persuasive worldview is built at the intersection of faith, science, and politics.
