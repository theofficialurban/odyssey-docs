## Overview

This **academic study** investigates the **phenomenology of group stalking**, often referred to as **"gang-stalking,"** by analyzing **subjective accounts** from individuals who believe they are being targeted. The researchers used **content analysis** to identify **twenty-four core phenomena**, ranging from **physical surveillance** and **electronic hacking** to more extreme beliefs like **mind control** and **body implants**. The findings highlight the **severe psychological distress** and **social isolation** experienced by these individuals, as well as a concerning **potential for violence** driven by feelings of persecution. By comparing these narratives to previous data, the authors establish a **foundational framework** for understanding a poorly researched but widespread experience. Ultimately, the source emphasizes the **devastating impact** this phenomenon has on the **well-being and functioning** of those who report it.

This research paper investigates the **phenomenology of gang-stalking**, a subjective experience where individuals believe they are being targeted by a coordinated group of multiple persecutors. By analyzing fifty first-hand accounts from the internet, the authors identify twenty-four **core phenomena** and eleven **psychological sequelae**, ranging from beliefs in mind control and electronic surveillance to severe emotional distress and social isolation. The study emphasizes that while these experiences often involve **complex conspiracy theories** and perceptions of a global "establishment cover-up," they result in high rates of **psychiatric morbidity** and significant functional impairment. Ultimately, the text serves to establish a foundational framework for a poorly understood phenomenon, highlighting a critical need for **further scientific exploration** and risk assessment due to the potential for violent responses from those who feel victimized.

## **The Hidden Hand of Gang-Stalking:** _What a Landmark Study Reveals About a Global Phenomenon_

It starts with a sound. The perfectly timed slam of a neighbor's door the second you sit down to relax. Then another—a cough, a laugh, a toilet flushing from the apartment next door, a symphony of harassment mocking your every move. You go outside, and cars tailgate you, the drivers speaking openly into walkie-talkies. In the supermarket, strangers use grocery carts to block your path, invading your personal space with chilling intent. This isn't the plot of a Cold War thriller; it's the subjective reality reported by a startling number of people around the globe—an experience that science is only now beginning to systematically investigate.

What if the feeling of being watched wasn't just in your head? What if it was a coordinated, 24/7 campaign of psychological warfare?

This experience, known as 'gang-stalking', is not a fringe belief confined to a handful of internet forums. Epidemiological data suggest it could affect as many as **0.66% of adult women** at some point in their lives, and a simple Google search for the term yields over **7.5 million results**. For decades, this phenomenon has existed in a gray area between conspiracy theory and unexamined trauma. But a groundbreaking 2020 study has finally dragged it into the light. By analyzing dozens of firsthand accounts, researchers have revealed the chillingly consistent patterns of this phenomenon, the devastating psychological fallout for those who experience it, and its disturbing connection to real-world violence. To understand this modern-day paranoia, we must first look at how the phenomenon was defined and brought out of the shadows.

### Charting the Conspiracy - A Modern History of Gang-Stalking

To study a phenomenon, you must first define it. This is a strategic imperative, especially for a concept as complex and socially challenging as gang-stalking. While individual stalking became a recognized crime and a subject of academic inquiry in the late 1980s, the idea of being targeted by a coordinated group has been largely ignored by researchers. It represents a different kind of terror—one that suggests a conspiracy so vast and insidious that it defies easy explanation or intervention.

### The Spark: From Back Alleys to Big Data

While the legal concept of stalking emerged in the late 1980s, the term 'gang-stalking' gained currency after the turn of the millennium, spreading rapidly across the internet. Despite its online prevalence, there remains a significant "dearth of research" on the topic (Sheridan et al., 2020, p. 2). This academic silence stands in stark contrast to the numbers. One study of _self-defined_ stalking victims found that **12.3%** reported being targeted by a group. A separate US Department of Justice study, which used a tight legal definition of stalking that required victims to experience fear, found that **6.8%** reported being targeted by three or more people and were unable to identify a single offender or an offender who was singularly responsible. Strikingly, when the DoJ removed the fear component from its definition, that figure jumped to **12.5%**—showing remarkable consistency with the self-reported data (Sheridan et al., 2020, p. 2).

This is where the landmark study by Lorraine Sheridan, David V. James, and Jayden Roth (2020) comes in. Rather than imposing existing frameworks from individual stalking cases, the researchers took a novel approach. They analyzed 50 detailed, self-published online accounts from self-described 'Targeted Individuals' (TIs). Their goal was to allow the core components of the gang-stalking experience to "emerge de novo," creating a classification system based entirely on the unfiltered testimony of those living it (Sheridan et al., 2020, p. 2-3). While this approach provides an unparalleled view, the researchers acknowledge a potential paradox: the very online forums that document these experiences may also act as "closed ideology echo chambers," shaping and reinforcing the beliefs they catalogue.

So what exactly did this unfiltered look into the lives of 'Targeted Individuals' reveal?

### The Anatomy of Persecution - Unpacking the Tactics

The study’s most significant contribution is its systematic anatomy of the gang-stalking experience. By analyzing the 50 narratives, the researchers identified 24 distinct categories of reported persecution. This framework moves the phenomenon from a collection of chaotic, disparate anecdotes into a structured, shared narrative with a disturbingly consistent playbook. For the first time, we can see the architecture of this perceived conspiracy from the inside.

### The Gang-Stalker's Playbook: Surveillance, Sabotage, and Mind Control

Among the 24 phenomena, a core set of tactics appeared with overwhelming frequency, forming the backbone of the gang-stalking experience. The top five reported experiences were:

1. **Physical Surveillance/Being Followed (94%):** This is the cornerstone of the experience. Victims report being followed constantly, on foot and by car. As one individual described, "As I drive down the road, multiple cars will start up and follow me" (Sheridan et al., 2020, p. 5).
2. **Victim of a Conspiracy (80%):** The stalking is not seen as random but as part of a massive, organized effort. Victims believe it involves multiple agencies, from "local police and other local agencies" to the FBI, CIA, and even international intelligence services (Sheridan et al., 2020, p. 5).
3. **Physical Interference, Intimidation, and Harassment (66%):** This involves overt acts designed to intimidate and disrupt. One account details how "strangers blocking my way using grocery carts, invading my personal space, cutting me off while I was walking or driving" (Sheridan et al., 2020, p. 5).
4. **Establishment Cover-up (64%):** A crucial element is the belief that the system is not just failing to help, but is actively complicit. Victims report that "The authorities finance, protect and organise the stalkers, and the media blank any coverage of it" (Sheridan et al., 2020, p. 6).
5. **Electronic Surveillance (60%):** The sense of being watched extends into the digital and physical home. Victims believe their residences are "electronically bugged" or that they are under "audio and visual surveillance" 24/7 (Sheridan et al., 2020, p. 6).

This feeling of systemic betrayal—that the very institutions meant to protect citizens are part of the conspiracy—creates a profound sense of helplessness. Police (Category 15) and medical practitioners (Category 23) are often seen as key conspirators, leading to a clash between the victim's reality and the official response.

| Clashing Realities: The TI Experience vs. The Official Response                       |                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A Targeted Individual Reports...**                                                  | **The Establishment's Perceived Reaction...**                                                  |
| "Hearing voices and insults transmitted directly into my head (V2K)."                 | A diagnosis of 'paranoid schizophrenic' by medical practitioners.                              |
| Presenting photos and license plates of stalkers to the police.                       | Police ignore the evidence, turning a blind eye.                                               |
| Experiencing clandestine entry into their home and electronic hacking.                | Being labelled as delusional by authorities, which has "ruined me."                            |
| Being subjected to remote mind control and physical ailments from electronic weapons. | Being "put into a mental ward" by the healthcare system after trying to report the experience. |

These reported tactics and systemic dismissals have profound, life-altering consequences, which the study also systematically documented for the first time.

### The Fallout - Modern Echoes and Dangerous Ends

The impact of perceived gang-stalking extends far beyond fear and paranoia. It fundamentally reshapes a person's life, health, finances, and psyche. The study reveals not only the devastating personal costs but also the troubling societal implications that arise when victims feel they have no other choice but to fight back against an invisible, all-powerful enemy.

### From Isolation to Escalation

The emotional and psychological toll is immense. The study's analysis of victim-reported consequences (sequelae) paints a grim picture:

- **Psychological Damage (42%):** Victims report severe depression, anxiety, and a loss of will to live. One individual stated, "I hate my life with such a passion that I am yet again depressed and sometimes the idea of death sounds inviting" (Sheridan et al., 2020, p. 10).
- **Isolation and Loneliness (34%):** The belief that friends, family, and neighbors could be part of the conspiracy leads to profound social withdrawal. "The biggest and most hurtful thing with gang stalking, is loneliness," one person wrote. Another added, "I choose to isolate and I trust virtually nobody" (Sheridan et al., 2020, p. 10).
- **Financial Losses (24%):** The constant stress, disruption, and efforts to escape take a heavy financial toll, with victims reporting that the perpetrators "are there to help you reach financial ruin!" (Sheridan et al., 2020, p. 11).

This spiral of distress, however, does not always end in quiet despair. A significant portion of victims report a **"Determination to fight back" (32%)**, and more alarmingly, the **"Development of hatred/violent tendencies" (16%)**. The narratives are filled with chilling statements of intent: "I may have to kill them before they kill me," and "I think the only way forward is to get some weapons and act" (Sheridan et al., 2020, p. 11).

This ideation is not merely theoretical. The study connects these experiences to real-world tragedies, citing Sarteschi's (2018) research on four self-described "targeted individuals" who, collectively, **killed 28 people**. The researchers note that many reported experiences—such as mind control, implanted devices, and V2K transmissions—are examples of "threat-control-override symptoms," a known psychiatric risk factor for violence (Sheridan et al., 2020, p. 15). The feeling of being physically invaded and controlled by an outside force can, in some cases, justify a pre-emptive, violent response in the mind of the sufferer.

This leaves us with several urgent, unanswered questions:

1. In an era of deep political distrust and ubiquitous digital surveillance, are we creating a fertile ground for such persecution narratives to take root and spread?
2. How can law enforcement and mental health systems effectively intervene when faced with claims that name them as part of the conspiracy?
3. What responsibility do internet platforms have in moderating communities that may act as "closed ideology echo chambers," potentially reinforcing beliefs that can lead to violence?

### Conclusion & Call to Action

The 2020 Sheridan, James, and Roth study does not validate the objective reality of gang-stalking. Instead, it does something arguably more important: it maps the contours of a subjective hell. It reveals the 'Targeted Individual' as a uniquely modern figure, standing at a dangerous intersection of pervasive digital surveillance, profound institutional distrust, and genuine mental distress. In a world where the state watches, corporations track, and online echo chambers reinforce our deepest fears, the study provides a vital framework for understanding a phenomenon that feels, to thousands of people, terrifyingly real.

Here are the key takeaways:

1. **A Shared, Structured Nightmare:** The experience of gang-stalking is not random; it's a phenomenon with a consistent playbook of 24 reported tactics, ranging from psychological operations to perceived physical and electronic attacks.
2. **The System as Accomplice:** A central tenet of the experience is the belief that official institutions—from the police to doctors—are complicit in the harassment, creating profound isolation and invalidation.
3. **A Pathway to Violence:** The severe psychological distress, combined with a feeling of having no recourse, can foster a desire to "fight back," which in rare and extreme cases has been linked to mass violence.

## **Understanding the Reported Experience of 'Gang-Stalking'**

### Introduction: A Look into a Complex Phenomenon

Gang-stalking, also known as group stalking, is defined in scientific literature as a reported experience of being stalked by multiple individuals who engage in a shared endeavor with a group purpose. This document explores the experiences reported by individuals who identify as victims of this phenomenon, often referring to themselves as "Targeted Individuals" or "TIs." All information presented is based on the findings of a 2020 scientific study by Lorraine Sheridan, David V. James, and Jayden Roth, which analyzed 50 personal accounts to understand this phenomenon from the perspective of those experiencing it. The study identified a wide range of reported incidents, which were organized into several core categories of experience.

### 1. The Six Core Categories of Reported Experiences

The study systematically analyzed personal narratives and organized the 24 most commonly reported types of incidents into six distinct thematic groups. These categories provide a framework for understanding the subjective reality of those who believe they are being gang-stalked. These categories range from the most commonly reported experience of direct physical surveillance (94%) to more specific beliefs like implanted devices (24%), providing a clear picture of the phenomenon's landscape. The following sections will explore each of these groups with key examples and illustrative quotes from the individuals' accounts.

#### 1.1. Invasive Attacks on the Body and Mind

This category includes experiences where individuals report feeling that their own bodies and minds are being attacked, manipulated, or controlled by external, often technological, forces.

- **Remote/Mind Control (40%)** Individuals describe the belief that their thoughts, actions, and even perceptions are being controlled by others through sophisticated methods.
- **Voice-to-Skull (V2K) Transmission (26%)** This refers to the reported experience of hearing voices, sounds, or direct communications transmitted into one's head, which are believed to be generated by advanced technology.
- **Implanted Devices (24%)** Many individuals report the belief that surveillance or control devices have been surgically and clandestinely implanted into their bodies without their consent.

#### 1.2. External Attacks on the Person

This category involves reports of direct physical harassment, overt intimidation, and sensory assaults from the outside world, perceived as being coordinated and deliberate.

- **Physical Harassment and Intimidation (66%)** These experiences include being physically blocked, intentionally bumped into in public, or having vehicles drive aggressively toward them in a threatening manner.
- **Targeted by Noise (44%)** This involves reports of coordinated noise campaigns, such as neighbors simultaneously slamming doors, using loud power tools at specific times, or creating other disruptive sounds intended to disturb sleep and daily life.

#### 1.3. Interference with Personal Environment

This category focuses on the reported invasion and manipulation of an individual's private spaces, including their home, property, and digital life.

- **Constant Surveillance** A core component of the experience is the feeling of being watched 24/7. Physical surveillance was the most frequently reported phenomenon in the study, cited by **94%** of individuals, while **60%** reported electronic surveillance through bugs or cameras.
- **Electronic Hacking (38%)** Individuals report that their personal electronic devices and accounts—such as computers, phones, emails, and social media—are compromised, monitored, or controlled by their persecutors.
- **Unauthorized Entry to Home (34%)** This involves the belief that perpetrators secretly enter the individual's home. Often, nothing is stolen, but items are moved or subtly altered to signal that the home has been breached.

#### 1.4. Assault on Reputation and Relationships

This category includes actions perceived as being taken to intentionally damage the individual's social standing, credibility, and relationships with other people.

- **Slander and Gossip (34%)** Individuals report that malicious lies and rumors are systematically spread about them to neighbors, employers, friends, and family in an effort to isolate them and destroy their reputation.
- **Targeting Friends and Family (26%)** Many believe the harassment extends beyond them to the people they are close to, either to turn those people against them or to make them targets as well.

#### 1.5. A Grand Conspiracy

This category describes the overarching belief system that interprets all the disparate events as being part of a single, large-scale, organized conspiracy involving powerful entities. This was reported by **80%** of individuals.

- **Multiple Agencies Involved** Individuals frequently believe that the stalking is perpetrated by a vast coalition of powerful and diverse organizations, including government agencies (FBI, CIA, MI5), police, military, and private entities like insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, and even terrorist cells.
- **Establishment Cover-Up (64%)** A central belief is that these same powerful organizations actively protect the stalkers, prevent any media coverage of the phenomenon, and ensure that no official investigation or intervention takes place.
- **Global Phenomenon (38%)** The experience is not seen as an isolated or local issue, but rather as part of a clandestine and coordinated program operating on a worldwide scale.

#### 1.6. Reinterpreting the Past

Reported by **34%** of individuals, this final category describes the cognitive process where individuals look back on their lives through the lens of their current experience. Previously confusing, random, or negative events are re-evaluated and seen as early evidence of a long-term, covert gang-stalking campaign.

I had been bullied at many different places. I thought they all happened because of my fault or I was just unlucky. Now I know that my perpetrators have been denying my basic human rights for years.

The profound nature of these reported experiences leads to a number of severe and life-altering consequences, which the study also analyzed.

### 2. The Reported Impact on Individuals

The study also identified the most common consequences, or "sequelae," that individuals reported as a result of their gang-stalking experiences. The researchers grouped these reported impacts into three main categories: psychological and physical effects, practical life disruptions, and the individual's responses.

#### 2.1. Psychological and Physical Toll

This category covers the severe negative effects that the reported experiences have on an individual's mental and physical well-being.

| Effect                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Psychological Damage (42%)**             | Individuals report high levels of depression, anxiety, fear, and confusion, often leading to doubting their own sanity.                                                      |
| **Isolation and Loneliness (34%)**         | A profound sense of being completely alone, friendless, and cut off from society is a frequently reported outcome.                                                           |
| **Stress-Related Physical Ailments (20%)** | The intense and prolonged stress is reported to cause physical symptoms such as headaches, back pain, chest pain, nausea, breathing problems, allergies, and sleep problems. |

#### 2.2. Practical Life Disruptions

This category details the tangible, real-world losses and dramatic changes individuals report making in their lives due to the perceived harassment.

- **Financial Losses (24%)** Individuals frequently report losing significant amounts of money or facing financial ruin, either from being unable to work or from the costs associated with the harassment.
- **Changed Lifestyle (26%)** To try and escape the perpetrators, individuals describe drastically changing their daily habits, stopping social activities, and sometimes moving homes or even countries repeatedly.

#### 2.3. Responses and Reactions

This category outlines the ways individuals report reacting to and coping with their situation, which range from seeking community to developing intense anger.

1. **Finding Support Online (26%)** The internet provides a crucial space for individuals to find websites and forums where they can connect with others who report similar experiences. This online community helps reduce their sense of isolation and validates their reality.
2. **Determination to Fight Back (32%)** Many individuals express a strong resolve to not be passive victims. They report a determination to expose their perpetrators, gather evidence, and bring public attention to the issue of gang-stalking.
3. **Development of Hatred/Violent Tendencies (16%)** The study found that the constant perceived persecution led some individuals to report developing intense anger, hatred, and, in some cases, violent fantasies or intentions toward their stalkers.

### 3. Conclusion: Key Takeaways

Based on the detailed analysis of personal accounts, we can draw several key conclusions about the reported phenomenon of gang-stalking.

1. **A Complex Set of Experiences** The reported experience is not a single act but a broad and complex collection of perceived events. These range from overt harassment and surveillance to deeply invasive beliefs about mind control, implanted devices, and vast, powerful conspiracies.
2. **Serious Reported Consequences** Regardless of the underlying cause, individuals who believe they are targeted by gang-stalking report severe and debilitating psychological, social, and financial harm that profoundly disrupts their lives.
3. **A Subjective Phenomenon** This document describes the _subjective experiences_ of gang-stalking as reported by individuals and analyzed in a scientific study. It offers a structured framework for understanding the phenomenon from the perspective of those who live it.

## **Key Findings on the Gang-Stalking Phenomenon: A Summary**

### Introduction: Understanding Gang-Stalking

Gang-stalking (or group stalking) is a pattern of repeated, unwanted intrusion into a person's life by multiple individuals who appear to be acting with a shared purpose. While the topic has received little scientific attention, the subjective experience of being gang-stalked is surprisingly widespread, with estimates suggesting it may affect as many as **0.66% of adult women and 0.17% of adult men** in the western world at some point in their lives. This document summarizes the core experiences and severe consequences reported by individuals who identify as victims, based on the findings of the Sheridan, James, and Roth (2020) study. To understand the impact of this phenomenon, we must first deconstruct the experience itself by examining the specific patterns of persecution reported by its victims.

### 1. The Reported Experience: A Framework of Persecution

The study analyzed detailed personal accounts to identify 24 core phenomena that define the subjective experience of being gang-stalked. Of these, the five most frequently reported experiences highlight a pattern of intense and pervasive surveillance and interference.

#### **Top 5 Most Common Reported Experiences**

| Phenomenon                                          | Frequency |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Physical surveillance/being followed                | `94%`     |
| Victim of a conspiracy (by multiple agencies)       | `80%`     |
| Physical interference, intimidation, and harassment | `66%`     |
| Establishment cover-up                              | `64%`     |
| Electronic Surveillance                             | `60%`     |

These top five experiences are not random; they fit directly into the study's broader framework. For example, "Physical surveillance" is a form of **Physical interference**, while the beliefs about a "Victim of a conspiracy" and an "Establishment cover-up" are core components of the **Interpretation of the gang-stalking's meaning**.

These individual experiences cluster into six distinct categories, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding the alleged persecution:

- **Invasive attack on the subject’s body:** This includes claims of being remotely mind-controlled, having surveillance devices implanted in one's body, or receiving "voice-to-skull" (V2K) transmissions.
- **Exterior attack on the person or their senses:** Individuals report overt harassment, such as being targeted by coordinated noise campaigns or subjected to physical attacks.
- **Physical interference with the individual’s environment or possessions:** This category involves experiences like being followed, having one's home entered without authorization, and being subjected to electronic hacking or vandalism.
- **Assault on reputation:** A key component is the belief that perpetrators are actively spreading slander and gossip to socially isolate the individual.
- **Individuals or agencies involved in the conspiracy:** Victims frequently report that neighbors, police, medical practitioners, and even their own family and friends are part of the coordinated harassment effort.
- **Interpretation of the gang-stalking's meaning:** These experiences often coalesce into a belief that the individual is the victim of a vast, global conspiracy involving powerful government agencies, with an official establishment cover-up preventing intervention.

This six-part framework demonstrates that the gang-stalking experience is not just a list of harassing acts, but a comprehensive worldview of persecution affecting one's body, environment, reputation, and social connections.

To illustrate the depth of these beliefs, one individual describing being the "Victim of a conspiracy" stated:

Who funds this crap? Are you sitting down? Do you have an ability to see beyond the obvious? If not, you are wasting my valuable time. Here is the list: Insurance companies, Government agencies which include Law enforcement, Military, Disability companies, Workers compensation, Pharmaceutical companies, Very rich individuals that have a vested or non-vested interest in another individual. CIA, FBI, Homeland security, Terrorist cells. To name a few.

Understanding this framework of perceived persecution is crucial, as these experiences do not occur in a vacuum; they produce a cascade of profound and damaging real-world consequences.

### 2. The Consequences (Sequelae): The Human Cost of Gang-Stalking

The study found that the cumulative experience of gang-stalking results in serious and harmful consequences (or sequelae) that impact an individual's psychological, practical, and social well-being. The three most commonly reported consequences were:

1. **Psychological Damage (42%):** Individuals report severe depression, self-doubt, chronic fear, and intense emotional distress as a direct result of their experiences.
2. **Isolation and Loneliness (34%):** The constant suspicion and perceived betrayal leads individuals to withdraw from social connections, often choosing to become a "hermit" because they feel they can trust no one.
3. **Determination to Fight Back (32%):** In response to the persecution, many develop a resolve to expose the perpetrators and organize with other victims to bring public awareness to the issue.

The study grouped all 11 reported sequelae into three main categories:

- **Psychological/physical effects:** Includes psychological damage, hopelessness, and physical ailments brought on by stress.
- **Practical effects/losses:** Encompasses financial ruin, lifestyle changes, and repeated, failed efforts to escape the stalkers by moving.
- **Fighting back:** Involves finding support online from other victims, a determination to expose the conspiracy, and in some cases, the development of violent tendencies.

Organized this way, the consequences show a complete erosion of a person's life: attacking their internal psychological state, their external practical stability, and their capacity to respond constructively.

The theme of social harm is particularly acute, with nearly a third of individuals reporting profound **Isolation and loneliness (34%)**. This feeling is captured powerfully in one personal account:

The biggest and most hurtful thing with gang stalking, is loneliness.

These devastating personal consequences, particularly the potential for violence, elevate the issue from individual suffering to a matter of public concern, underscoring the study's urgent final conclusions.

### 3. Broader Implications and Conclusion

The seriousness of the gang-stalking phenomenon is underscored by the finding that some victims develop **hatred/violent tendencies (16%)**. The intense stress and perceived threat can lead to thoughts of pre-emptive violence, as one individual expressed with chilling clarity: "I may have to kill them before they kill me." This highlights the potential for tragic outcomes when these experiences are not addressed.

The study concludes that the subjective experience of being gang-stalked is a widespread phenomenon that, despite its prevalence, has been subject to very little scientific examination. The research confirms that the experience has demonstrably harmful and deleterious effects on sufferers, ranging from severe psychological distress to social isolation and financial ruin.

Ultimately, these findings provide a critical foundation for understanding the core components of the gang-stalking experience. They confirm the need for this phenomenon to be regarded as an important subject for future research to better support those who suffer from it and to mitigate potential risks of violence.

## **An Overview of the Gang-Stalking Phenomenon: A Synthesis of Subjective Experiences and Reported Sequelae**

### **1.0 Introduction: Defining the Gang-Stalking Phenomenon and the Research Imperative**

The term "gang-stalking" has gained significant currency on the internet and in media reports since the turn of the millennium, describing a distressing and persecutory experience reported by a growing number of individuals. Despite its widespread subjective reporting, the phenomenon remains critically under-researched, creating a significant knowledge gap for professionals in mental health, law enforcement, and threat assessment who may encounter individuals describing these experiences. Understanding the nature and impact of gang-stalking is therefore a strategic imperative for developing informed and effective professional responses.

Unlike the more commonly studied phenomenon of stalking by a single individual, "gang-stalking" or "group stalking" is defined as a pattern of repeated, unwanted intrusion by three or more individuals who engage in a shared endeavor with a group purpose. While research into individual stalking is well-established, gang-stalking represents a distinct subjective experience that requires its own empirical framework. Deriving a potential prevalence figure is instructive: given that available evidence suggests approximately 12% of stalking reports involve multiple perpetrators and that, at a conservative estimate, 8% of women and 2% of men are stalked at some point in their lives, it appears the subjective experience of being gang-stalked could affect approximately **0.66% of adult women** and **0.17% of adult men** in the western world.

This potential prevalence stands in stark contrast to the state of scientific inquiry. A Google search for "gang-stalking" conducted on 5 February 2020 produced 7,550,000 "hits," yet prior to the publication of the source study for this synthesis, only one empirical paper on the topic could be located in the published literature. This discrepancy highlights an urgent need to systematically document and analyze the subjective reality of those who report being targeted. This document synthesizes the findings of a foundational study that sought to identify the core phenomena and sequelae of the gang-stalking experience, providing a clear framework of the persecution as described by those who endure it.

### **2.0 The Core Phenomena: A Framework of Subjective Experience**

To construct an empirically derived understanding of the gang-stalking experience, a systematic content analysis was performed on 50 detailed, self-published accounts from individuals who identify as victims. This qualitative approach, which allowed themes to emerge _de novo_ from the narratives rather than being imposed by a pre-existing framework, resulted in the identification of 24 distinct categories of experience. These phenomena, organized into six thematic clusters, offer a foundational framework for understanding the subjective reality of those who refer to themselves as "targeted individuals" (TIs).

#### **Cluster 1: Invasive Attacks on the Subject's Body**

This cluster involves phenomena that are perceived as profoundly invasive, breaching the individual's physical and mental autonomy. These experiences are characterized by a sense of being violated by unseen, often technological, forces that directly affect the body and mind.

- Being remotely controlled/mind control (40%)
- Physical ailments as a direct result of gang-stalking (e.g., poisoning, irradiation) (36%)
- Voice to skull (V2K) transmission (i.e., hearing voices/sounds transmitted into the head) (26%)
- Control and surveillance devices implanted into body (24%)

#### **Cluster 2: Exterior Attacks on the Person or Senses**

This group of experiences focuses on direct harassment, physical intimidation, and sensory assault from external sources. These are overt acts intended to cause distress, fear, and disruption in the individual's daily life.

- Physical interference, intimidation, and harassment (e.g., being blocked, bumped into) (66%)
- Targeted by noise (e.g., timed door-slamming, loud power tools) (44%)
- Physical attacks (22%)

#### **Cluster 3: Interference with Personal Environment and Possessions**

This cluster encompasses actions that violate the individual's private space, data, and property. These phenomena create an environment of constant vulnerability, where the boundaries of home, personal data, and even relationships are breached. The most frequently reported phenomenon across all clusters falls within this group.

- Physical surveillance/being followed (94%)
- Electronic surveillance (e.g., home being bugged) (60%)
- Subject to electronic hacking (e.g., passwords and emails compromised) (38%)
- Subject to clandestine, unauthorized entry to home (34%)
- Vandalism/theft of personal property (32%)
- Family and friends of victim also targeted (26%)

#### **Cluster 4: Assault on Reputation**

This cluster centers on the perceived effort to damage the individual's social standing, credibility, and relationships through malicious gossip and disinformation campaigns.

- Targeted by slander/gossip (e.g., being falsely labeled a criminal or mentally ill) (34%)

#### **Cluster 5: Perceived Perpetrators and Collaborators**

This cluster reflects the belief that a wide array of societal institutions and individuals are complicit in the stalking campaign. This perception extends from official bodies to the most intimate personal relationships, fostering a sense of profound betrayal and systemic persecution.

- Police as part of the conspiracy (32%)
- Neighbors as part of the conspiracy (26%)
- Family/friends as part of the conspiracy (24%)
- Producing ‘evidence’ of gang-stalking fails to persuade authorities to intervene (20%)
- Medical practitioners as part of the conspiracy (20%)

#### **Cluster 6: Interpretive and Grand-Narrative Frameworks**

This final cluster comprises the cognitive frameworks that individuals use to make sense of their pervasive and often bewildering experiences. These interpretations frequently involve large-scale, powerful, and secretive conspiracies that provide an explanation for the relentless persecution.

- Victim of a conspiracy (by multiple agencies) (80%)
- Establishment cover-up (64%)
- Victimized as part of a global phenomenon (38%)
- Reinterpretation of past events in light of the gang-stalking experiences (34%)
- Complained that they didn’t know why they were being stalked (16%)

These clusters illuminate the content of the reported persecution. The next section examines the attributions individuals make about the purpose behind these experiences.

### **3.0 Perceived Motivations and Duration of the Experience**

While a majority of individuals reported not knowing why they were targeted, a significant portion (20 of the 50 accounts) offered explanations. These attributions are clinically significant as they form the cognitive architecture of the persecutory belief system, providing insight into how individuals rationalize their experience.

A critical finding is that in all cases where a reason was provided, no single named person was identified as the ultimate perpetrator. Instead, the motivations consistently externalize agency to powerful, impersonal entities, experiments, or clandestine agendas. The range of perceived reasons included:

- Being part of a brainwashing military experiment designed to suppress anti-government actions.
- Serving as an unwilling test subject for mind-control weaponry.
- Being targeted for being vocally anti-government or anti-corporation.
- Retaliation for refusing to join a "devil cult" or become an operative.
- Being monitored as part of a long-term study on the effects of previously implanted devices.
- A mechanism for government agencies to secure more federal funding for mental health initiatives.

The enduring nature of the gang-stalking experience is another defining feature. In the analyzed accounts, **none of the narratives described the persecution as having ended**. All authors reported lengthy periods of being targeted, with durations ranging from "months" to over "22 years." The chronic, unending nature of the reported persecution, combined with the belief that it is orchestrated by vast, impersonal forces, creates a psychological trap from which there is no apparent escape, leading directly to the severe sequelae documented by victims.

### **4.0 The Sequelae: Psychological, Practical, and Behavioral Impacts**

The reported experience of gang-stalking is associated with severe and multifaceted consequences that degrade an individual's well-being and ability to function. The analysis identified 11 principal sequelae, which underscore the profoundly deleterious effects of this phenomenon. These impacts span the psychological, practical, and behavioral domains, as detailed below.

| Category of Impact                            | Prevalence (%) | Key Characteristics                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Psychological damage                          | 42             | Reports of severe depression, persistent fear, confusion, self-doubt, and suicidal ideation.                           |
| Isolation and loneliness                      | 34             | Descriptions of being friendless, choosing to self-isolate, and the complete loss of social relationships.             |
| Determination to fight back                   | 32             | A stated resolve to expose the perpetrators, bring the issue into public awareness, and organize with others.          |
| Resentment/distress at being treated as crazy | 28             | Feelings of offense and distress from being dismissed by others as "paranoid" or "crazy."                              |
| Found support from other victims online       | 26             | Seeking and finding solace, validation, and community through websites and forums for targeted individuals.            |
| Changed lifestyle                             | 26             | Inability to live a normal life, including avoiding public places, changing all habits, and ceasing social activities. |
| Financial losses                              | 24             | Reports of financial ruin, significant monetary losses, and damage to one's professional name.                         |
| Physical ailments as a result of stress       | 20             | Development of physical symptoms like headaches, back pain, and nausea attributed directly to the worry and stress.    |
| Development of hatred/violent tendencies      | 16             | Expressions of intense hatred toward perpetrators, violent fantasies, and statements of intent to use violence.        |
| Escaping from gang-stalkers                   | 14             | Repeatedly moving, including interstate and internationally, only to find that the persecution follows.                |
| Feelings of hopelessness                      | 14             | Pervasive despair, learned helplessness, and a belief that life has no future.                                         |

The researchers organized these 11 sequelae into three thematic groups:

1. **Psychological/physical effects:** This group captures the immense internal toll of the experience, including psychological damage, isolation, stress-induced physical ailments, and profound hopelessness.
2. **Practical effects/losses:** This group reflects the tangible, real-world consequences, such as financial ruin, forced changes to lifestyle, and fruitless attempts to escape the perceived persecution.
3. **Fighting back:** This group highlights the active responses of individuals, which range from seeking online support and resolving to expose the conspiracy, to the development of violent ideation.

The findings related to aggression are particularly noteworthy for risk assessment. A significant minority of individuals expressed a "determination to fight back" (32%) or the "development of hatred/violent tendencies" (16%). The intensity of these feelings is captured in statements such as, **"I may have to kill them before they kill me."** This dimension of the experience has critical implications for professionals working in clinical and forensic contexts.

### **5.0 Conclusion: Synthesis and Implications for Professional Practice**

The synthesis of available research demonstrates that the gang-stalking experience, while not well understood scientifically, is a subjectively real and deeply harmful phenomenon for those who report it. The experience is characterized by a consistent pattern of perceived persecution, surveillance, and harassment by multiple parties, leading to severe psychological, practical, and behavioral consequences.

The primary contribution of the foundational study discussed here is its provision of the first empirically derived phenomenology of the gang-stalking experience. By allowing categories to emerge directly from victim accounts, it offers a framework free from the preconceived notions of individual stalking. This methodological shift is critical because it validates the unique structure of the gang-stalking experience as a distinct phenomenon, rather than simply a variant of individual stalking with more perpetrators. It demonstrates that the core themes of systemic conspiracy and technological violation are central to this experience, not peripheral artifacts. The validity of these findings is strengthened by comparison with the only other empirical study in the field (Sheridan and James, 2015). Despite employing different methodologies, both studies identified the same core themes and confirmed the seriousness of the reported sequelae, suggesting they are examining the same fundamental phenomenon.

These findings carry critical implications for professionals who may encounter individuals reporting these experiences.

1. **For Mental Health Professionals:** Recognizing the reported phenomena and their severe psychological impact—including symptoms of depression, post-traumatic stress, and profound despair—is essential. The presentation poses a unique clinical challenge, as the belief that medical practitioners are part of the conspiracy (reported by 20% of individuals) can severely compromise the therapeutic alliance and complicate diagnostic differentiation from recognized psychotic disorders. The focus must be on alleviating the profound subjective distress while navigating these complex relational dynamics.
2. **For Law Enforcement and Threat Assessment Professionals:** The connection between reported experiences and potential for violence warrants careful consideration. Certain reported phenomena—particularly those in the "Invasive Attacks on the Subject's Body" cluster, such as mind control and implanted devices—constitute what are known as **"threat-control-override symptoms."** These specific belief types, which reflect a breakdown in reality testing, have been empirically linked to an increased risk of violence. Furthermore, reports indicating the development of hatred and violent tendencies (16%), which can include homicidal ideation, are a red-flag factor in established threat assessment protocols and must be taken seriously as an indicator of elevated risk.

Ultimately, the experience of gang-stalking is a complex and damaging phenomenon that exists at the intersection of mental health, victimology, and public safety. This synthesis underscores the urgent need for further research to better understand its etiology, validate its core features across larger samples, and develop effective, evidence-based strategies for intervention and support.

## **INTERNAL MEMORANDUM:** _Risk Assessment Considerations for Perceived Gang-Stalking_

### **1.0 Purpose of Memorandum**

The purpose of this memorandum is to synthesize key findings from recent research to inform and enhance professional risk assessment practices concerning individuals who report being victims of "gang-stalking." This document focuses specifically on reported aggression, violent ideation, and clinically significant symptoms relevant to threat assessment, based exclusively on the findings of Sheridan, James, & Roth (2020). To properly evaluate these risk factors, it is essential to first understand the context of the gang-stalking phenomenon.

### **2.0 Background: The "Gang-Stalking" Phenomenon**

Professionals in clinical and law enforcement settings may encounter individuals reporting experiences of "gang-stalking." Understanding the subjective nature of this experience is crucial for establishing rapport and conducting an effective assessment, rather than defaulting to a dismissive stance that may preclude the gathering of critical threat information. The source research defines "gang-stalking" as stalking by multiple individuals (three or more) who are engaged in a shared endeavor with a group purpose.

While research is limited, existing data indicates a notable prevalence, with one study finding that 12.3% of self-defined stalking victims reported group-stalking. Epidemiological estimates suggest that the subjective experience could affect approximately 0.66% of adult women and 0.17% of adult men in the western world at some point in their lives. The seriousness of the psychological impact is confirmed by the study, which found that individuals reporting gang-stalking scored significantly higher on ratings of depressive symptoms and post-traumatic symptomatology than those stalked by individuals. Beyond this general distress, specific reported reactions and beliefs warrant closer examination from a threat assessment perspective.

### **3.0 Analysis of Reported Aggression and Violent Ideation**

The direct analysis of an individual's stated mindset and intent is paramount in any risk assessment. The following indicators, identified in the source research, represent distinct levels of escalating risk that require careful evaluation.

#### **3.1 Determination to Fight Back**

The study found that 32% of individuals described a "determination to fight back" against their perceived persecutors. While not inherently violent, this represents a critical psychological shift from passive victimhood to an oppositional posture, which can be a precursor to planned aggression. Exemplar quotes from the study illustrate this perspective:

:::highlight
"I’ve decided I can surrender, or I can fight, so I’m ready and prepared to have as big a mouth about this as I can."
:::

or

:::highlight
"We can either go out on our feet or our knees and I plan to sell myself for as high a price as I can reap from them."
:::

#### **3.2 Development of Hatred and Violent Tendencies**

A more explicit and concerning category, "development of hatred/violent tendencies," was reported by 16% of the sample. This finding is highly significant as it represents a direct expression of violent ideation, including fantasies of killing the perceived persecutors and viewing weapons as a necessary next step. Direct quotes from the study provide clear examples:

:::highlight
"I may have to kill them before they kill me."
:::

or

:::highlight
"I fantasize about killing them in many possible ways..."
:::

or

:::highlight
"I think the only way forward is to get some weapons and act."
:::

While these direct expressions of violent ideation are overt risk factors, they are frequently accompanied by a specific cluster of delusional beliefs, known as Threat-Control-Override symptoms, which provide the underlying justification for potential violence.

### **4.0 Identification of Threat-Control-Override (TCO) Symptoms**

The identification of Threat-Control-Override (TCO) symptoms is of strategic importance in risk assessment, as existing literature cited in the source study has linked this symptom class with an increased risk of violence.

The study by Sheridan, James, & Roth explicitly categorizes a group of reported experiences as constituting examples of TCO symptoms. The frequency of these reported experiences within the sample is notable:

- **Being remotely controlled/mind control** (40%)
- **Physical ailments as a direct result of gang-stalking** (36%)
- **Voice-to-skull (V2K) transmission** (26%)
- **Control and surveillance devices implanted into body** (24%)

The implication of these findings is critical. The belief that one is being controlled, physically harmed, or subjected to invasive technological influence is a recognized risk factor. This belief system, where an individual feels their body and mind are under invasive attack, directly informs the rationale for pre-emptive violence detailed in precedent cases—framing homicide as a necessary act of self-defense.

### **5.0 Link to Precedent Cases and Established Risk Protocols**

Connecting research findings to real-world violent events and established professional standards provides essential context for assessment. The source study highlights this connection by referencing precedent cases and existing risk assessment frameworks.

The study cites work by Sarteschi (2018), which described four cases of men who, believing they were "targeted individuals" subject to "gang-stalking," collectively killed 28 people and injured 12. Their violence was motivated by a perceived need for self-defense in the form of a pre-emptive strike and a desire to alert the world to the danger they believed they faced.

Furthermore, the study authors explicitly note that the reported experiences and quotes regarding violent ideation would satisfy criteria for red-flag violence risk items in two specific, widely recognized threat assessment guides:

- **The Stalking Risk Profile** (under the items "homicidal ideation" and "high-risk phenomena").
- **The Communications Threat Assessment Protocol**.

These findings collectively point to several critical considerations for professionals conducting risk assessments in this context.

### **6.0 Key Takeaways for Risk Assessment and Intervention**

This section consolidates the key risk indicators identified in this memorandum for operational use. The purpose is to provide actionable insights for professionals encountering individuals who report experiences consistent with the "gang-stalking" phenomenon.

1. **Isolate and Document Expressions of Aggression:** Actively screen for reports of a "determination to fight back" (32%) and, more critically, the "development of hatred/violent tendencies" (16%). The latter category can include explicit homicidal ideation and must be treated with the utmost seriousness.
2. **Screen for TCO Symptoms:** Be aware that experiences such as mind control, Voice-to-Skull (V2K) transmissions, implanted devices, and physical ailments attributed to stalking are reported by a substantial portion of this population. The source study explicitly identifies these as TCO symptoms, which research has linked to an increased risk of violence.
3. **Recognize Potential for Pre-emptive Violence:** Understand that, based on cited precedent cases, violence may be motivated by a perceived need for self-defense against an overwhelming persecutory force or a desire to bring public attention to their perceived victimization.
4. **Apply Standardized Risk Protocols:** Evaluate cases presenting these features with the full rigor of established protocols, such as **The Stalking Risk Profile**. The reported ideations and phenomena align with high-risk indicators and warrant the same professional diligence applied to other potential threats of violence.

These findings underscore the critical need for diligent, structured assessment and mandate careful consideration for intervention when these specific risk factors are present.
