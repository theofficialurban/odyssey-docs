# Scarlet & The Beast (John Daniel) {#title}

[[toc]]

## Overview

The provided text, excerpts from _Scarlet and the Beast_ by John Daniel, presents an elaborate and often conspiratorial Christian interpretation of history and prophecy. It argues that a **Luciferian conspiracy**, often equated with **Mystery Babylon** (identified as **English Freemasonry**), seeks to establish a global government known as the **New World Order**. This overarching plot, which the author traces back to Babylon, involves various groups like Jesuits, world bankers, and corrupted Protestant pastors, all allegedly allied through **Freemasonry** and harboring an intense hatred of the **Old World Order** (Jews and Christians). The source extensively details the history of **Freemasonry**—splitting into English and French (Templar) obediences—and connects it to revolutionary movements like the **French Revolution** and the **Bolshevik Revolution**, with figures such as <LinkPreview href="./pike-letter.html">**Albert Pike**, **Mazzini**</LinkPreview>, and even American founding father **Benjamin Franklin** portrayed as key conspirators or agents of groups like the **Priory of Sion** and the **Illuminati**. The author urges Christians to **"Come out of her"** (Freemasonry/Mystery Babylon) and repeatedly links the organization to paganism, occult groups like the **Golden Dawn**, and the financing of wars and subversive political actions, including the rise of **Hitler** and the alleged control of modern institutions like the **Council on Foreign Relations** and the **United Nations**.

This extensive selection from *Scarlet and the Beast* presents a detailed, biblically-focused **conspiracy theory** arguing that a millennia-old spiritual and political conflict drives world history. The central thesis posits that the **Old World Order**, embodied by the Judeo-Christian faith, is being systematically dismantled by two primary, interwoven Masonic conspiracies: **English Freemasonry** (identified as the religious "Mystery Babylon") and **French Freemasonry** (identified as the political "Beast"). The text meticulously traces the alleged historical connections between these groups, the **Priory of Sion**, the **Knights Templar**, and revolutionary movements—from the Merovingian bloodline and the Holy Grail to the Illuminati, the French Revolution, the World Wars, and the rise of communism—all working toward establishing a Luciferian **New World Order**. Ultimately, the author intends to expose Freemasonry as a pagan, anti-Christian religion with the final, secret goal of achieving global political and spiritual dominion by manipulating world finance, media, and education, urging Christians to recognize and **"Come out of her"** before the prophesied end times.

## **A Learner's Guide to the Secret Societies**

This guide is designed to unravel the complex and often confusing relationships between several of history's most famous secret societies. Based exclusively on the provided historical text, we will explore how a single, ancient conflict connects them all. As this guide will demonstrate, these seemingly separate groups are not isolated entities, but are instead key players in a centuries-long covert war between two irreconcilable ideologies: one fighting for a divinely ordained, aristocratic world order, and the other for a revolutionary, democratic one born from betrayal and a thirst for revenge.

### 1. The Common Ancestor: The Priory of Sion

At the heart of this intricate web is the Priory of Sion, presented by the source as the original, ancestral secret society from which the others in this guide diverge. Its core identity and mission are defined by its ancient lineage and a singular, powerful belief.

The three most important characteristics of the Priory of Sion are:

- **Origin:** The organization traces its lineage back to the Merovingian Dynasty of France, established in 496 A.D. According to the source, the Priory of Sion was formally established in 1090 to advance the Merovingian claim to the throne of Jerusalem, thereby protecting and legitimizing their sacred bloodline.
- **Core Belief (The "Holy Grail"):** The Priory's central belief is that the Merovingian bloodline descends directly from the union of Jesus and Mary Magdalene. This lineage is what they refer to as the "Holy Grail." Their ultimate goal is to restore a Merovingian descendant to a global throne—specifically, to rule the world from the Davidic throne in Jerusalem.
- **Role:** The Priory of Sion is positioned as the "mother" organization. It is the original body that created and, for a time, controlled the other major groups that emerged from this history.

To protect its interests and advance its sacred claim, the Priory of Sion found it necessary to create a powerful new arm for defense and administration.

### 2. The Great Schism: The Rise and Fall of the Knights Templar

In 1118, the Priory of Sion founded the Knights Templar for a specific purpose: to serve as its "military and administrative arm." Their primary duty was to protect the interests of Sion and the Merovingian "King of Jerusalem" cult.

However, the Templars soon underwent a profound transformation after discovering what the source alleges was the lost treasure of King Solomon, hinted at in the Dead Sea Scrolls and buried beneath the ruins of his temple. They used this immense wealth to pioneer the institution of modern banking, and as their power grew, they became bankers to the thrones of Europe. This newfound independence marked the first act of rebellion in a war that would redefine covert history, as they began to neglect their sworn duties to the Priory of Sion.

This growing independence culminated in a pivotal moment of separation known as the **"Cutting of the Elm"** in 1188, which formalized the schism between the two orders. Despite this public split, the source notes that the Priory of Sion continued to exercise "clandestine control" over Templar affairs, even assisting in their eventual persecution and downfall. This moment reveals the ruthless pragmatism of the Priory of Sion; it was willing to help destroy its own rebellious creation to maintain ultimate control and secrecy.

This schism marked the great divergence, setting the stage for the Priory of Sion and the remnants of the Knights Templar to evolve into two distinct and warring factions.

### 3. The Two Warring Factions of Freemasonry

After the 1188 schism, the Priory of Sion and the Knights Templar followed separate, clandestine paths. These paths eventually led to the formation of two rival branches of Freemasonry, which the source describes as having been locked in a "bitter and sustained conflict" ever since. Each branch inherited the ideology and allegiances of its parent organization.

#### 3.1. The Sionist Path: English Freemasonry

After separating from the Templars, the Priory of Sion began operating through a new front group: Rosicrucianism. The text describes Rosicrucianism as the "immediate father of Freemasonry," which directly led to the establishment of the **United Grand Lodge of England in 1717**. This branch represents the direct continuation of the Priory of Sion's agenda.

English Freemasonry is characterized as follows:

- **Allegiance:** Controlled by and loyal to the Priory of Sion.
- **Ideology:** Fundamentally aristocratic, pro-business, and capitalistic, favoring a Constitutional Monarchy as the ideal form of government.
- **Alias:** Sometimes referred to as **Rosicrucian or Sionist Freemasonry**.

#### 3.2. The Templar Path: French Freemasonry

After their persecution in the 14th century, the surviving Knights Templar fled to Scotland, where they secretly maintained their order for centuries. These "Scottish Templars" eventually returned to France in the company of the exiled Prince Charles Edward Stuart. There, in **1725**, they founded what would become **French Freemasonry**, also known as the **Scottish Rite**.

French Freemasonry is characterized as follows:

- **Allegiance:** The direct heir to the legacy and grievances of the Knights Templar.
- **Ideology:** Inherently revolutionary, anti-monarchist, and democratic in its ideals.
- **Alias:** Sometimes referred to as **Jacobite Masonry or the Scottish Rite**.

For a time, however, these two bitter rivals found a compelling reason to collaborate on a secret and ambitious project designed to reshape the political landscape of Europe.

### 4. A Tool for Revolution: The Illuminati Project

The source presents the Illuminati not as the ultimate secret power, but rather as a short-lived "cooperative venture"—a temporary tool created by the higher powers of _both_ the Sionist and Templar factions to achieve a specific goal.

The symbolic meaning of the **Seal of the Illuminati** illustrates this joint effort:

- **The Unfinished Pyramid:** This represents the monumental task assigned to the Knights Templar and their descendants—the building of a new world government.
- **The All-Seeing Eye:** Hovering above the pyramid, this represents the watchful, guiding oversight of the Priory of Sion, ensuring the project proceeds according to its plan.

The Illuminati's primary function was to "penetrate and ultimately transform French Freemasonry on the Continent into a revolutionary power." It was designed to radicalize existing Masonic lodges and weaponize them to bring about world-changing events, most notably the French Revolution.

To fully grasp the battle lines of this covert war, the following table provides a clear, side-by-side comparison of the key players.

### 5. At a Glance: Comparing the Secret Societies

This table synthesizes the information from the previous sections, offering a clear, comparative overview of each secret society's origin, goals, and relationship to the others.

| Secret Society          | Ultimate Origin (per source)           | Stated Goal / Ideology                                                            | Key Relationship                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Priory of Sion**      | Merovingian Dynasty ("Holy Bloodline") | World rule by a Merovingian king from the throne of David.                        | The "mother" organization of the English Masonic line.                                 |
| **Knights Templar**     | Created by Priory of Sion in 1118      | Originally to protect Sion's interests; later focused on banking and wealth.      | Sion's military arm that rebelled, leading to the creation of the French Masonic line. |
| **English Freemasonry** | Priory of Sion (via Rosicrucians)      | A New World Order based on a Constitutional Monarchy and aristocracy.             | Sion's primary vehicle; the "most bitter enemy" of French Freemasonry.                 |
| **French Freemasonry**  | Knights Templar (via Scottish exiles)  | A New World Order based on democracy and revolution; revenge on Crown and Church. | The Templar's primary vehicle; the main rival to English Freemasonry.                  |
| **The Illuminati**      | A "cooperative venture"                | To infiltrate and radicalize continental Freemasonry for revolutionary purposes.  | A temporary tool used by the higher powers of both factions.                           |

With this comparative framework in place, the overarching narrative of this centuries-long conflict becomes clear, allowing us to draw a final, unifying conclusion.

### 6. Conclusion: An Ancient War, A Single Conspiracy

As this guide demonstrates, the provided text presents a unified theory connecting these famous secret societies. They are not isolated phenomena but are all deeply interconnected players in what the source frames as a centuries-long "war between English and French Freemasonry." This fundamental conflict—between a faction loyal to the aristocratic, monarchical ideals of the Priory of Sion and another loyal to the revolutionary, democratic legacy of the Knights Templar—serves as the primary lens through which their complex historical interactions and hidden agendas can be understood.

## **Unveiling Freemasonry: An Introduction to its Symbols, Beliefs, and Rituals**

### A Note on Your Guide

Welcome. This document serves as a beginner's guide to the core concepts of Freemasonry, aiming to illuminate its foundational beliefs, symbols, and organizational structure. It is essential for the reader to understand that this exploration is not a comprehensive, external analysis of the institution. Instead, it is a structured summary drawn exclusively from the perspective and specific claims presented within the historical text, _**Scarlet and the Beast**_ by John Daniel. All descriptions of Masonic doctrine, symbolism, and history herein are a direct reflection of the arguments found within that source.

### 1. Is Freemasonry a Religion?

The fundamental question of Freemasonry's identity is directly addressed by the source text, which argues that it is, unequivocally, a religious institution. This claim is supported by quoting high-ranking Masons themselves. Albert Pike, a prominent 33rd degree Mason, is cited as stating:

Every Masonic Lodge is a temple of religion; and its teachings are instructions in religion.

According to the source, while Freemasonry may appear to be a Christian-friendly fraternity to new or low-level members, it functions as a universal mystery religion at its core. It is designed to transcend specific faiths, bringing together Christians, Jews, Muslims, and others under a single, moral system. The text posits, however, that this universality comes at a cost for its Christian members. They are forbidden from introducing their "peculiar opinions" regarding Jesus Christ into the Lodge. Furthermore, the source makes the grave claim that a minister praying in the name of Christ would be reprimanded by a pre-appointed member of the lodge.

This characterization of Freemasonry as a distinct religious system, separate from Christianity, provides a crucial foundation for understanding the nature of its specific beliefs.

### 2. The Core Beliefs: A Dualistic Universe

The central philosophical belief of Freemasonry, as presented in the source, is a gnostic concept of a dualistic universe. This worldview posits an eternal struggle between two opposing divine forces. The source claims that, at the highest levels of initiation, members learn that this conflict is not between God and Satan, but between "Lucifer, God of Light and God of Good," and "Adonay, the God of Darkness and Evil." In this interpretation, the roles are inverted from traditional Judeo-Christian theology.

The following table summarizes the roles of these two deities as described within the source text:

| Deity       | Role According to the Source                                                                         |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lucifer** | The "God of Light and Good," struggling for humanity's freedom and scientific achievement.           |
| **Adonay**  | The "God of Darkness and Evil," who unjustly cast Lucifer from heaven and robs man of his potential. |

This dualistic framework is the esoteric key to unlocking the meaning behind Freemasonry's most prominent symbols.

### 3. Decoding the Symbols

According to the source text, Freemasonry is a system of "veiled allegory and symbol," designed to conceal its true, esoteric meanings from the uninitiated public and its own lower-level members. The explanations given to novices are described as "designedly misleading interpretations" intended to hide deeper truths.

#### 3.1. The Six-Pointed Star

The source identifies the six-pointed star as a foundational symbol in Freemasonry, representing the "good and evil powers in life." Its origins are traced to the gnostic Visigoths and the Merovingian bloodline through a secret society known as the Priory of Sion. The text notes that this symbol is often found inlaid in the lobby floors of modern Masonic Lodges.

#### 3.2. The Square and Compass

The familiar Square and Compass, perhaps the most recognizable emblem of Freemasonry, is described as having developed directly from the six-pointed star. It carries forward the same underlying dualistic principles embodied in the star from which it originated.

#### 3.3. The All-Seeing Eye and the Unfinished Pyramid

The source identifies the "Seal of the Illuminati"—an unfinished pyramid topped by a hovering, eye-in-a-triangle capstone—as a symbol adopted by American Freemasonry and famously placed on the back of the United States one-dollar bill. The text presents three layers of esoteric meaning for this emblem:

- **The Eye:** It represents the watchful control of Adam Weishaupt (founder of the Illuminati) and the Priory of Sion over their grand project.
- **The Unfinished Pyramid:** This symbolizes the great task assigned to the spiritual descendants of the Knights Templar: the building of a unified world government.
- **The Hovering Capstone:** This signifies the Masonic rejection of Jesus Christ as the "Chief Cornerstone." In this symbolic system, the Master Mason himself completes his work and becomes the capstone of a "Universal Temple," achieving his own salvation.

Ultimately, each of these core symbols—the star, the Square and Compass, and the Seal—serves to reinforce the central Gnostic dualism that the source presents as Freemasonry's foundational secret: a cosmic battle between opposing forces, hidden in plain sight from the uninitiated.

### 4. The Structure of Freemasonry: A Ladder of Secrets

The source portrays Freemasonry not as a monolithic organization, but as a hierarchical system of degrees designed to methodically veil deeper truths from newer members. Albert Pike is quoted as offering this stark explanation of the order's structure:

The Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portico of the Temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the Initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false interpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand them...

The key levels of this structure, as detailed in the source, are:

1. **The Blue Lodge** This is the foundation of Freemasonry, comprising the first three degrees: "Entered Apprentice," "Fellow Craft," and "Master Mason." The names of these degrees, the source explains, reflect the organization's origins in the stonemason guilds of Europe.
2. **The Scottish Rite** This advanced system contains 33 degrees of initiation. The source text claims its structure is based on the Jewish Cabala, a mystical system that, according to the author's interpretation of the Bible, led Jesus Christ to refer to it as the "synagogue of Satan." The text argues that the 33 degrees were developed from the ten Sephiroth, or emanations, of the Cabalistic "tree of life," which it terms the "serpent religion."
3. **The Supreme Council** The 33rd degree is identified as the "controlling" degree of Freemasonry. Its members are called "Sovereign Grand Inspectors General" and they form the Supreme Council, which is the highest ruling body of the order.
4. **The Hidden Hierarchy** Finally, the source claims that even within this highest ruling body exists another, even more secret society. This inner circle is said to be composed of approximately 300 men who possess the one true interpretation of Freemasonry's symbols and ultimate goals.

This intricate structure was not born in a vacuum, but was forged in a historical conflict that the source claims created the two great rival branches of the organization.

### 5. The Two Faces of Freemasonry: A History of Conflict

The source text posits a grand theory of modern history: that it can be understood as a centuries-long conflict between two primary, and opposing, branches of Freemasonry. These two powers, though derived from the same operative Masonic roots, evolved with fundamentally different philosophies and geopolitical goals.

The following table compares these two branches based on the descriptions provided in the text:

| Feature               | English Freemasonry (Sion/Rosicrucian)                    | French Freemasonry (Templar/Scottish Rite)      |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Alleged Origin**    | Priory of Sion and Rosicrucianism.                        | Exiled Knights Templar who fled to Scotland.    |
| **Core Philosophy**   | Deistic/Pantheistic; aristocratic and pro-monarchy.       | Atheist/Humanist; democratic and revolutionary. |
| **Primary Rival**     | The Grand Orient Lodge of Paris.                          | The Grand Mother Lodge of London.               |
| **Geopolitical Goal** | Establish a New World Order controlled by an aristocracy. | Establish a Universal Democratic Republic.      |

Despite being "bitter enemies" in a struggle for global control, the source makes a final, crucial point: these two powers are still "brothers." They are said to unite only when they must confront what the text identifies as their one common enemy. According to Daniel's argument, this enemy was "initially the Catholic Church. Today it is all Christendom."

### 6. Conclusion: A Beginner's Key Takeaways

Drawing exclusively from the claims within _Scarlet and the Beast_, a beginner can synthesize the complex world of Freemasonry into four central themes. According to the source text:

- **Freemasonry as a Religion:** It is presented as a universal, pagan religion that is fundamentally incompatible with Christianity. At its highest echelons, it allegedly reveals itself as a system of Luciferian doctrine, where Lucifer is the god of good and light.
- **Veiled Symbolism:** Its core symbols—such as the All-Seeing Eye, the Square and Compass, and the six-pointed star—possess hidden, esoteric meanings that are deliberately concealed from the public and lower-level members.
- **Hierarchical Secrecy:** The organization's degree system is a carefully constructed ladder of knowledge, designed to intentionally mislead initiates in the early stages while reserving the true agenda and interpretation of its philosophy for a small, secret ruling council at the top.
- **A World in Conflict:** Modern Freemasonry is defined by a historical and ongoing power struggle between its two primary branches—the aristocratic English rite and the revolutionary French rite—who are rivals in a grand project to establish a New World Order.

As this guide demonstrates, the Freemasonry depicted within _Scarlet and the Beast_ is not merely a fraternity, but a comprehensive religious and political system with a hidden, world-altering agenda—an interpretation that stands as a significant, if highly controversial, entry in the annals of conspiratorial history.

## **Scarlet and the Beast: A Chronicle of the Secret War in Freemasonry**

### 1.0 The Ancient Schism: Origins of a Millennial Conflict

To comprehend the great geopolitical conflicts of modern history, one must look beyond the official narratives of nations and ideologies. The evidence trail, pieced together from suppressed histories and esoteric texts, reveals that these events are but battles in a clandestine war, a struggle whose origins trace back to an ancient schism between two powerful and enigmatic orders: the Priory of Sion and the Knights Templar. This foundational split, rooted in claims of blasphemous bloodlines and a bid for absolute power, created two opposing forces that would eventually manifest as rival branches of Freemasonry. Their millennial-long conflict is the hidden key to understanding our world.

The key to this entire conflict lies in a blasphemous reinterpretation of the Holy Grail legend, a secret the Priory of Sion was created to preserve. This order’s origins are entwined with the Merovingian Dynasty, which began its rule in 496 A.D. In their telling, the Grail is not a sacred cup but a royal bloodline—a lineage descending from a purported union between Jesus and Mary Magdalene. The Merovingians claim to be the inheritors of this sacrilegious union, descendants of the Davidic line destined to rule. This assertion, detailed in parchments discovered in modern times, is captured in a ciphered heading: _"To Dagobert II King and to Sion belongs this treasure and he is there dead."_ This points to the Merovingian king whose lineage, though excised from official histories, was secretly guarded by the Priory.

To protect this bloodline and its claim to the throne of Israel, the Priory of Sion established a military and administrative arm. In 1118, the Knights Templar were founded, their initial purpose being to serve as protectors of the Merovingian “King of Jerusalem.” Their name was derived from their specific quarters in a fortified abbey situated “above the ruins of Solomon's Temple,” a location that spurred their search for the ancient king’s unfathomable treasure. For seven decades, the Templars served as the sworn sword of the Sionist cult.

This powerful alliance, however, was not destined to last. A critical turning point occurred in 1188 at an event known as the **"Cutting of the Elm."** This moment marked the formal and bitter separation between the Priory of Sion and the Knights Templar, setting them on divergent and adversarial paths. The schism was not merely a political disagreement but the genesis of the dual-conspiracy framework that would define their conflict for the next millennium. From this ancient fracture, two warring secret societies began their long and covert struggle for world dominion.

### 2.0 Two Paths, Two Destinies: The Formation of Rival Freemasonries

The centuries following the 1188 schism were a period of strategic evolution. While the Priory of Sion pursued its goals through intellectual and mystical infiltration, the Knights Templar, hardened by persecution, cultivated a revolutionary fervor. During this time, Sion and the Temple followed distinct paths, developing the unique philosophies and methodologies that would culminate in the creation of their own rival branches of Freemasonry. This divergence laid the groundwork for their conflict to erupt on a global scale.

The contrasting development of these two powers reveals the ideological chasm that would define their future war.

| The Path of Sion (English Freemasonry)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | The Path of the Temple (French Freemasonry)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| After separating from the Templars, the Priory of Sion operated through more subtle means, creating the esoteric order of **Rosicrucianism**. In the 1600s, Sion strategically "grafted" Rosicrucian mysteries onto the operative stonemason guilds of England. This fusion of esoteric philosophy with established craft traditions gave birth to speculative English Freemasonry. Key intellectual figures, later identified as Grand Masters of Sion, such as **Robert Boyle** and **Sir Isaac Newton**, guided this new order. | Following the schism and their brutal persecution by Crown and Church in the early 1300s, the surviving Knights Templar fled to the sanctuary of Scotland, where their order was preserved. To keep the memory of their destruction alive, they adopted the Masonic legend of **Hiram Abif**, the builder of Solomon's Temple. His murder became a powerful symbol for the destruction of their own order and fueled their undying desire for revenge against both Monarchy and the Catholic Church. |
| The ideology of English Freemasonry was shaped by its aristocratic and intellectual leadership. It is characterized as **deistic**, politically aligned with **constitutional monarchy**, and philosophically pro-business and capitalistic. It represents what can be understood as a "right-wing" conspiracy, seeking to establish a world order controlled by a financial and hereditary elite.                                                                                                                                 | The ideology of French Freemasonry was forged in persecution and exile, making it inherently revolutionary. It is characterized as **atheistic or humanist**, politically aligned with **democracy and republicanism**, and fiercely opposed to the old orders of church and state. It represents what can be considered a "left-wing" conspiracy, aiming to establish a universal secular republic.                                                                                                 |

This ideological divergence was formalized with the establishment of two distinct Masonic rites. In 1717, the Priory of Sion unified the lodges of England under the authority of the **Grand Mother Lodge** in London. In a masterful historical irony, this Sionist body seized control of the financial systems first established by their ancient rivals; having discovered Solomon’s treasure, it was the Templars who created modern banking, the very weapon their enemies would perfect to control global commerce. In contrast, French Freemasonry was officially founded in 1725 by exiled Scottish Stuart supporters. Known as the **Scottish Rite**, its Templar heritage was unmistakable, establishing it as the revolutionary adversary to the English order.

With their structures formalized and their opposing worldviews solidified, these adversarial Masonic powers were poised to turn the stage of world history into their clandestine battlefield.

### 3.0 The Age of Revolutions: A Clandestine War for World Order

The 18th and 19th centuries became the primary arena for the conflict between English and French Freemasonry. The great historical upheavals of this era were not spontaneous events but orchestrated battles in an ongoing war. Each revolution was a calculated move designed to advance one faction's vision for a New World Order, fought by proxy through political movements and the unsuspecting masses.

#### The Glorious Revolution of 1688

The first major victory was secured by the Sionist-Rosicrucian faction. The **Glorious Revolution of 1688** was a strategic triumph for English Freemasonry, establishing a Constitutional Monarchy in Britain that secured the financial and political interests of the aristocracy and the burgeoning merchant class. It was a victory for the "right-wing" conspiracy, cementing a stable power base from which to expand its influence.

#### The American Revolution of 1776

The **American Revolution** represents a more complex interplay. While primarily a **Templar-led revolution** driven by French Masonic ideals of democracy, it was influenced by the Sionist secret society, the Illuminati. The United States was established as a ground for a symbolic reconciliation between the two warring brotherhoods. This intended union is evidenced in the esoteric symbols of the **Great Seal of the United States**, which incorporates emblems sacred to both Sion and the Temple, signifying a shared project.

#### The French Revolution of 1789

If America was a compromise, the **French Revolution** was the ultimate and bloody revenge of Templar Freemasonry. Its goal, in its own words, was the "'complete annihilation of Catholicism, and ultimately of Christianity.'" It was the symbolic and literal avenging of Jacques de Molay, the last Grand Master of the Templars, burned at the stake by the French monarchy and the Catholic Church. The evidence for this is unmistakable: the revolutionary **Jacobin Clubs** that served as the vehicle for the "Reign of Terror" chose their name in honor of **Jacques de Molay**, systematically destroying the French monarchy and the Church to fulfill the Templars' centuries-old vow of vengeance.

#### The Russian Revolution of 1917

The **Russian Revolution** unfolded as a two-stage conflict between the factions. First, the provisional government under Alexander Kerensky was backed by **English Masonic interests** and Rothschild financing, its purpose being to manage the rise of Zionism. Second, this government was swiftly overthrown by the Bolsheviks. This counter-revolution, led by Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky, was backed by **French (Grand Orient) Masonic interests** and Warburg financing, establishing a communist state as a radical fulfillment of the Templar vision of a godless, universal republic.

Thus, the age of political revolutions, fought with ideology and barricades, bled into the 20th century, where the Masonic war would be waged on an industrial scale with the most devastating weapons mankind had ever conceived.

### 4.0 Global Conflict in the 20th Century: The Hitler Project and its Aftermath

The unresolved Masonic conflict escalated dramatically in the 20th century, culminating in two world wars. These were not merely conflicts between nations but calculated maneuvers by the secret brotherhoods. World War II, in particular, reveals a Machiavellian strategy by the English faction to eliminate its continental rivals, a terrifying plan known as the "Hitler Project."

#### A Machiavellian Gambit: The "Hitler Project"

The evidence trail reveals that English Freemasonry and its aristocratic "British race patriots"—a circle including Cecil Rhodes and the elite Round Table groups—secretly funded the rise of Adolf Hitler. The strategic goal was brutally simple: to unleash the Nazi war machine on Europe as a blunt instrument to destroy both **French Grand Orient Freemasonry** and its revolutionary offspring, **Soviet Communism**. By financing a force hostile to both of its primary adversaries, the English oligarchy aimed to clear the board in a single, catastrophic stroke.

#### Occultic Bloodlines: The Esoteric Roots of Nazism

This was no mere geopolitical maneuver; it was a multi-layered occult deception. The connection between English secret societies and Nazism was deeply esoteric.

- The ideological seeds were sown by the Rosicrucian author **Bulwer-Lytton**, whose 1871 novel _Vril: The Power of the Coming Race_ became a foundational text for German occultists.
- Inspired by Lytton’s work, the **Thule Society** was founded, serving as the occult core of the nascent Nazi movement. It was within this circle that a young Adolf Hitler was discovered and groomed.
- The Thule Society then provided Hitler with the infamous anti-Semitic forgery, _The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Sion_. Here, the deception reached its apex. Investigation reveals the _Protocols_ to be a dezinformatsiya project created by the **Priory of Sion** itself—a counterfeit Jewish conspiracy text, authored by the parent organization of English Freemasonry, designed to scapegoat the Jews and provide a smokescreen for its own plans.
- Conduits such as the **Order of the Golden Dawn** and the homicidal **Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.)**, the latter led by Aleister Crowley who allegedly performed at least 150 human sacrifices, acted as linking sub-lodges between English and German esoteric circles.

#### A New World Order Forged in Fire

The "Hitler Project" was a partial, horrific success. The Nazis obliterated much of continental Freemasonry, but Hitler's eventual turn against his English backers sealed his downfall. With Germany's defeat, the post-war order was shaped by the victors. The establishment of the **United Nations**, largely orchestrated by English Freemasonry's American front, the **Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)**, represented the capstone of this victory. The "right-wing" Masonic conspiracy, operating through its Anglo-American centers, now presided over the new world it had engineered through war, setting the stage for the final act of the prophesied endgame.

### 5.0 The Prophesied Endgame: Identifying Scarlet, the Beast, and the New Atlantis

The centuries-long clandestine war has brought the world to its prophetic conclusion. The conflict has forged two dominant power centers, which occulted texts identify with the apocalyptic figures from biblical prophecy: "Scarlet, the Whore of Babylon" and "the Beast." Their intertwined legacy is deeply embedded in the political, economic, and symbolic structure of the modern world, setting the stage for a final confrontation.

The two primary entities driving this endgame are identified as follows:

- **Scarlet, the Whore of Babylon:** This entity is **English Freemasonry**. Its modern headquarters is **London**, the world's undisputed financial center, fabulously rich with Solomon's treasure, which its ancient rivals first discovered. From this seat of power, perfected through the system of banking the Templars invented, it controls the arteries of global commerce and the vast profits of the illegal drug trade. Scarlet represents the spiritual and financial corruption holding sway over the world.
- **The Beast:** This entity is the **United States of America**. The U.S. is the prophesied revived Roman Empire—a democratic republic "born out of the sea" through a Templar Masonic revolution. America embodies the "New Atlantis," the philosophical utopia of esoteric thinkers, and wields the immense political and military power born from the ideals of French Freemasonry.

#### The Great Seal: A Testament in Symbol

The ultimate evidence of this unified, yet dual, Masonic plan is presented in the symbolism of **The Great Seal of the United States**. Its two sides represent a symbolic contract between the rival brotherhoods.

- The **left side** depicts an unfinished pyramid topped by the All-Seeing Eye. This represents the **Priory of Sion** (English Freemasonry) as the overseer, watching the ongoing work assigned to the Templars: the building of the universal democratic republic. The hovering, separate capstone also carries a deeper, blasphemous meaning: it symbolizes the Masonic rejection of Jesus Christ as the "Chief Cornerstone," a role the Master Mason usurps for himself.
- The **right side** features an eagle (a phoenix) beneath a six-pointed star. This represents the political union of Sion and the Temple. The eagle is the ancient symbol of the Roman empire, signifying America's destiny as the revived Rome, while the six-pointed star—the herald of Sion—is formed from thirteen Templar stars, symbolizing Sion's ultimate authority over the Templar-built state.

The central thesis of this chronicle is that modern history has been secretly shaped by a war between two adversarial branches of a single brotherhood. This conflict has culminated in a New World Order led by the political and military might of America (the Beast), which operates under the financial and spiritual influence of London (Scarlet). Together, they have brought the world to the precipice of a final, prophesied confrontation.

## **Clandestine Orders and Geopolitical Influence: An Analysis of a Unified Conspiracy Theory**

### 1.0 Introduction: The Unifying Thesis of a Mystery Religion

This paper explores the complex thesis, presented in the source text _Scarlet and the Beast_, that a singular, overarching conspiracy unified by the "mystery religion" of Freemasonry has covertly manipulated global events for centuries. The central argument posits that world history, particularly since the 17th century, is not a series of random occurrences but a meticulously scripted conflict between rival esoteric factions laboring toward a common goal: the establishment of a "New World Order." This analysis will synthesize the provided material to trace the historical development, doctrinal schisms, and alleged influence of key clandestine organizations, from the medieval Knights Templar to modern political fronts.

The core of this global intrigue is interpreted through the biblical lens of a long-running war between two primary Masonic factions: English and French Freemasonry. The source identifies these powers with the prophetic archetypes from the Book of Revelation, designating the English lineage with "Scarlet" (Mystery Babylon, the Harlot) and the French with the "Beast." While sharing a common enemy in traditional religious and monarchical structures, these two powers are locked in a bitter conflict for ultimate control of the envisioned global government. This paper will deconstruct this narrative by first examining the doctrinal and religious foundations that allegedly animate these secret societies. It will then trace the historical schism that gave rise to the two competing lineages before analyzing their purported roles in orchestrating the great political upheavals of the modern era, including the Glorious, American, and French Revolutions. Finally, it will investigate the modern manifestations of this conflict through an examination of 20th-century wars and the network of front organizations that allegedly continue to advance the conspiracy today.

### 2.0 The Doctrinal and Religious Foundations of Freemasonry

To comprehend the historical claims central to this analysis, the source material presents Freemasonry not as a benign fraternal club but as a religious institution with a distinct and hierarchical doctrine. According to this narrative, the order's geopolitical actions are animated by a complex spiritual framework veiled in allegory and symbolism. This section will deconstruct the core tenets, esoteric origins, and layered system of knowledge that allegedly define Freemasonry as a unified, yet secretive, religious power.

The assertion that Freemasonry constitutes a religion is supported by its most esteemed authorities. Albert Pike, a 33rd-degree Mason, stated unequivocally in _Morals and Dogma_, "Every Masonic Lodge is a temple of religion; and its teachings are instructions in religion." This is affirmed by fellow 33rd-degree Mason Albert Mackey, who in his _Textbook of Masonic Jurisprudence_ describes Masonry as "undoubtedly a religious institution." Despite this, the source is clear that Freemasonry is not a Christian institution. This is evidenced by the strict prohibition against praying in the name of Jesus Christ within the Lodge, a practice which, if violated, must be officially reported. Its religious framework is instead presented as a universalist system that transcends specific faiths, aiming to unite all men at a "shrine all men might worship."

The doctrines of this religion are allegedly syncretic, drawing from a wide array of pagan and esoteric traditions. Its symbolism and philosophy are rooted in ancient sun worship, with lodges situated in upper chambers to emulate the ancient practice of worshiping celestial bodies on hills. Another primary source of inspiration is the Jewish Cabala, from which the source claims the Masonic Lodge drew much of its initial dogma and the structure of its degree system, based on the ten emanations known as the "ten Sephiroth." The image of King Solomon's Temple is also a central symbol, though its interpretation diverges sharply from its Judeo-Christian context.

Crucially, this doctrinal system is organized around a division between esoteric (inner) and exoteric (outer) knowledge. The order is accused of using layered symbolism and "designedly misleading interpretations" to conceal its true purposes from lower-degree initiates while progressively revealing them to the higher echelons. The 33rd-degree Mason is privy to the complete doctrine, while the vast majority of members in the "Blue Degrees" are given only allegorical teachings. As Masonic author W.L. Wilmshurst explains in _The Meaning of Masonry_, "Our teaching is purposely veiled in allegory and symbol and its deeper import does not appear on the surface." This hierarchical dissemination of knowledge ensures that only a select few within the Supreme Council understand the order's ultimate aims. These complex doctrines did not emerge in a vacuum but were forged and refined over centuries of conflict, rooted in a historic schism that split the esoteric world in two.

### 3.0 The Historical Schism: Two Competing Masonic Lineages

The central dynamic of the alleged global conspiracy is not a monolithic force but a bitter, sustained conflict between two distinct esoteric traditions. This rivalry, which predates modern Freemasonry, is presented as the primary engine of historical change. The two factions are traced back to a pivotal 12th-century separation between the Priory of Sion and its military arm, the Knights Templar. Over centuries, these organizations allegedly evolved, giving rise to the two competing branches of modern Freemasonry, which the source contrasts as follows: the aristocratic, Rosicrucian-influenced English faction and the revolutionary, Templar-descended French faction. The English/Sionist tradition is characterized by its strategy of "gradualism" and its goal of a financial and monarchical oligarchy, while the French/Templar tradition is defined by its doctrine of revenge and its use of violent upheaval to establish a universal democratic republic.

#### 3.1 The Priory of Sion and the Rosicrucian Tradition: The Roots of English Freemasonry

The lineage the source identifies with "Scarlet," or English Freemasonry, is traced back to the Merovingian Dynasty of the 5th century. Central to its identity is the legend of the "Holy Grail," reinterpreted not as a cup but as the royal bloodline (_sang real_) of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene. The Merovingians, claiming direct descent from this union, are thus positioned as the rightful heirs to the throne of David. Their ultimate goal is the establishment of a "Universal Throne in Europe" to be held by a Merovingian "Lost King" who, according to the source's interpretation of their doctrine, would also be acclaimed as the "Messiah of Israel."

To advance this claim, the Priory of Sion was founded in 1090 with the express purpose of protecting the Merovingian bloodline. The assassination of the Merovingian King Dagobert II in the 7th century is a pivotal event in this tradition, with the Priory dedicated to preserving his lineage and restoring it to power.

In 1188, following a schism with the Knights Templar, the Priory of Sion is said to have created Rosicrucianism as its new esoteric front. Individuals like Robert Fludd, a Grand Master of the Priory, are described as "the immediate father of Freemasonry," linking Rosicrucian philosophy directly to the craft. According to this narrative, Rosicrucianism, carrying the ancient Merovingian agenda, "grafted upon" the operative mason guilds of England in the 17th century, transforming them into the speculative lodges of modern English Freemasonry.

#### 3.2 The Knights Templar and the Jacobite Tradition: The Genesis of French Freemasonry

The rival lineage, interpreted as the "Beast," originates with the Knights Templar, who were officially founded in 1118 as the military protectors of the Priory of Sion and its Merovingian "King of Jerusalem." Stationed on the Temple Mount, the Templars allegedly discovered the hidden treasure of King Solomon, which became the basis of their immense wealth and their creation of the modern banking system.

The "Cutting of the Elm" at Gisors in 1188 marks the pivotal moment of separation between the Priory and the Templars, setting them on a path of enduring rivalry. This split left the Templars independent and powerful but also vulnerable. In 1307, King Philip the Fair of France, with the complicity of the Pope, moved to destroy the order. The subsequent persecution and execution of Templar leaders, culminating in the burning at the stake of Grand Master Jacques de Molay in 1314, became a catalyst for a new Templar doctrine: a vow of eternal revenge against Crown and Church. The source material draws a powerful esoteric connection here, stating, "To keep vivid their memory of this atrocity, the Templars who fled to Scotland adopted the legend of the death of Hiram Abif... as symbolic of the destruction of their order."

According to the source, the Templars survived by fleeing to Scotland, where they found refuge under King Robert the Bruce. For four centuries, the order maintained itself as a coherent body. When the Scottish Stuart kings were exiled to France after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, their Jacobite supporters, infused with this Templar tradition, founded French Freemasonry in 1725. This new order, known as the Scottish Rite, became the vehicle for the Templars' revolutionary agenda. This set the stage for a new phase of conflict, where these two rival esoteric factions would orchestrate the major political revolutions of the modern era.

### 4.0 The Age of Revolutions: Masonic Factions on the World Stage

The historical conflict between the Rosicrucian and Templar factions allegedly manifested as a series of world-altering political revolutions that defined the modern era. The source material frames these events not as spontaneous uprisings but as calculated maneuvers in the long war between English and French Freemasonry. This section will analyze the source's claims regarding the deep Masonic involvement in the Glorious, American, and French Revolutions, which are portrayed as critical battles in their struggle for global supremacy.

#### 4.1 The Glorious Revolution (1688): The Triumph of English Freemasonry

The English Civil War and the subsequent Glorious Revolution are framed as the decisive victory of the Rosicrucian-backed Masonic oligarchy over the Templar-aligned Stuart monarchy. This conflict consolidated the power of English Freemasonry, which forged a powerful and lasting alliance with the new Protestant Hanoverian monarchy and the Church of England. Following the revolution, the scattered lodges of English Freemasonry were unified under a single Grand Mother Lodge in 1717, an entity the source claims was controlled by the Priory of Sion. This event cemented the power of an aristocratic, pro-business oligarchy that would use the burgeoning British Empire as a vehicle for its global ambitions.

#### 4.2 The American Revolution (1776): A "Philosophical Atlantis"

According to the source's narrative, the American Revolution was fundamentally a Templar Masonic project, representing a direct challenge to the Rosicrucian power base in Britain. Templar influence was spread through military lodges established in the colonies, which fostered a revolutionary spirit. The source explains this was a project to resurrect a fabled democratic utopia, a "Philosophical Atlantis" that would serve as a model for a New World Order and resurrect a lost "empire of wise men." A key figure in this movement was Benjamin Franklin, described as a high-level initiate in both Templar and Illuminati lodges who worked to unite these factions. The source asserts that the vast majority of the Founding Fathers, at least 53 of the 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence, and 30 of Washington's 33 generals were Freemasons, demonstrating the depth of the order's control over the revolutionary cause.

#### 4.3 The French Revolution (1789): The Templars' Revenge

The text depicts the French Revolution as the bloody culmination of the Knights Templars' centuries-long quest for revenge against the French monarchy and the Catholic Church—the two institutions responsible for their persecution. The primary vehicles for orchestrating the revolution were the Jacobin Clubs, which were heavily influenced by Adam Weishaupt's Illuminati. The source claims that the very name "Jacobin" was chosen as a tribute to Jacques de Molay, the last Grand Master of the Templars. The subsequent "Reign of Terror" was the fulfillment of the Templar vow to destroy Crown and Church, establishing a pattern of revolutionary violence that would be replicated across Europe. These revolutions, born from the bitter rivalry of the two Masonic factions, established the patterns of conflict and subversion that would be systematized by organizations like the Illuminati and carried into the modern age.

### 5.0 The Illuminati: A Catalyst for Global Subversion

The Order of the Illuminati, founded by Adam Weishaupt on May 1, 1776, is presented by the source as a pivotal secret society that served as a cooperative venture between the two Masonic powers, though ultimately controlled by the Priory of Sion. Its primary mission was to penetrate, radicalize, and unify Continental Freemasonry, transforming it into a potent revolutionary force. The Illuminati's doctrines were designed to be superimposed upon existing Masonic lodges, allowing a small, secret cadre of initiates to steer the entire fraternity toward a predetermined political agenda.

The symbolism of the Seal of the Illuminati is analyzed as a clear representation of this cooperative mission. The seal features an unfinished 13-layered pyramid, which symbolizes the ongoing work of the Knights Templar to build a new world order. Hovering above it is a capstone containing the All-Seeing Eye, representing the oversight and ultimate authority of the Priory of Sion. The source interprets this design to mean that the Templars are tasked with building the global government, but under the watchful eye and direction of their ancient rivals.

This very seal, created for a Bavarian secret society, is claimed to have a direct and profound connection to the United States. According to the source, the Seal of the Illuminati was adopted as part of the Great Seal of the United States and has adorned the back of the one-dollar bill since 1934. This was allegedly done to signify America's unique and particular role in bringing about the "New World Order." Key figures such as Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams are cited as being responsible for bringing the Illuminati's influence to the American colonies. Though the Illuminati as a formal organization was short-lived, its Luciferian doctrine and subversive methods did not disappear but were absorbed into the highest echelons of Freemasonry, influencing the geopolitical conflicts of the 20th century.

### 6.0 Twentieth-Century Upheavals: World Wars and Ideological Conflict

The 20th century, according to the source text's narrative, witnessed the clandestine Masonic conflict escalate from national revolutions to devastating global wars. The great upheavals of this period—World War I, the Russian Revolution, and World War II—are interpreted not as products of conventional political tensions, but as meticulously engineered stages in the ongoing struggle between English and French Freemasonry. Each conflict served to destroy the old world order and advance the competing agendas of the two factions in their quest for a unified world government.

#### 6.1 World War I and the Fall of Monarchies

The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, the event that triggered World War I, is presented as a premeditated act planned within the Grand Orient lodges of French Freemasonry. The Archduke was allegedly targeted because he was perceived as an obstacle to their revolutionary aims. The war's outcome is framed as a decisive victory for the faction interpreted as the "Beast." It resulted in the destruction of their primary monarchical enemies—the German, Austro-Hungarian, and Russian empires—and cleared the path for the establishment of republican governments across Europe. The creation of the League of Nations is seen as the first significant attempt by the French Grand Orient to establish a universal democratic republic.

#### 6.2 The Russian Revolution (1917)

The source contends that the Russian Revolution was fomented by international Freemasonry but simultaneously represented a battleground between the two rival factions. The initial socialist revolution was led by Alexander Kerensky, who is identified with the English Masonic sphere and backed by Rothschild financing. This was quickly overthrown by the more radical Bolsheviks, led by Lenin and Trotsky, who are aligned with the French Grand Orient and funded by the Warburg banking family. The significant involvement of Jewish individuals in both movements is framed as a manipulated conflict between Zionist forces (aligned with the English faction) and anti-Zionist, internationalist forces used by the French faction.

#### 6.3 The "Hitler Project" and World War II

The rise of Nazism is presented through the provocative thesis of a "Hitler Project," allegedly engineered by English Freemasonry as a counter-force to the influence of French Freemasonry and its creation, the Soviet Union. The esoteric roots of Nazism are traced back to occult secret societies founded or heavily influenced by English Freemasonry, including the Order of the Golden Dawn, the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), and the Thule Society. The text further argues for Hitler's manipulation by connecting this project to his personal immersion in the very same esoteric traditions that animate the English/Sionist faction, citing his obsession with the "Spear of Longinus" and the belief that its possession would allow him to rule the world.

The source documents the alleged financial backing of Hitler's regime by Anglophile entities, most notably the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). This support was intended to build Germany into a weapon capable of destroying the Soviet Union. The ultimate outcome of World War II, according to this narrative, was the collapse of the French-backed League of Nations and the establishment of the United Nations—a new body for world governance conceived and controlled by English Freemasonry through its powerful American front, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR).

### 7.0 Modern Manifestations and the "New Age"

The historical Masonic conspiracy, as detailed in the source material, continues to operate in the modern era through a complex network of ancillary organizations and a pervasive cultural movement. These fronts are designed to subtly shape public policy, control finance, and prepare the global population psychologically for a New World Order. Each organization is identified as an instrument of either the English or French Masonic faction, continuing their centuries-old conflict through more sophisticated and covert means.

The following organizations are identified by the source as key modern fronts:

- **The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) and The Trilateral Commission:** These influential "think tanks" are described as primary fronts for English Freemasonry. They advance its agenda of "gradualism" by shaping foreign policy, influencing governments, and promoting economic internationalism under the control of an Anglo-American elite.
- **The Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.):** This is characterized as a degenerate and homicidal sub-lodge of English Freemasonry, famously led by the Satanist Aleister Crowley. The source makes the shocking claim that Crowley "allegedly performed at least 150 human sacrifices on the unholy altars of the O.T.O.," and that its influence is traced through modern Satanism and the rock music industry.
- **The National Council of Churches (NCC):** This organization is presented as an instrument created by figures like Jacob Schiff and the Rockefeller family with the explicit goal of diluting and ultimately destroying traditional Christianity from within. By promoting a secular, humanistic agenda, it allegedly works to undermine core biblical doctrines.
- **The New Age Movement:** This broad spiritual movement is posited not as a grassroots phenomenon but an ideological project promoted by organizations linked to English Freemasonry, such as the Lucis Trust (which was founded as the Lucifer Publishing Company). Its purpose is to replace traditional religions with a syncretic, Luciferian worldview that conditions society to accept a Masonic world teacher.

These modern manifestations, as presented in the source, demonstrate the conspiracy's evolution from direct political revolution to a more subtle war for control over the institutions and belief systems that shape modern society.

### 8.0 Conclusion

This analysis has synthesized the source material's central thesis: that world history since the 17th century has been shaped by a scripted conflict between two rival branches of a single Masonic conspiracy. This grand narrative presents a hidden war interpreted through the prophetic archetypes of "Scarlet" and the "Beast," which the source identifies with the aristocratic, Rosicrucian-influenced English faction and the revolutionary, Templar-descended French faction, respectively. The English branch, operating through a strategy of "gradualism," seeks a New World Order governed by a financial oligarchy and a "Universal Throne in Europe" held by a Merovingian "Lost King" who would also be acclaimed as the "Messiah of Israel." In contrast, the French branch pursues a universal democratic republic, born from violent revolution and a historic quest for revenge against Crown and Church.

From the Glorious Revolution to the World Wars of the 20th century, major historical events are reinterpreted as battles in this clandestine struggle. The rise of communism, the financing of Nazism, and the creation of global institutions like the League of Nations and the United Nations are all framed as strategic maneuvers by one faction against the other. According to this narrative, these competing yet philosophically related forces continue to manipulate global affairs through a network of secret societies, political front organizations, and cultural movements. Their shared, ultimate aim remains the complete annihilation of the Old World Order and the inauguration of a unified, secular global government, with the final victor poised to rule a long-planned New World Order.
